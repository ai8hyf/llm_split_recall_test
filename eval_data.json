We challenge AI models with three tasks derived from the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest: matching a joke to a cartoon, identifying a winning caption, and explaining why a winning caption is funny. These tasks encapsulate progressively more sophisticated aspects of \u201cunderstanding\u201d a cartoon; key elements are the complex, often surprising relationships between images and captions and the frequent inclusion of indirect and playful allusions to human experience and culture. We investigate both multimodal and language-only models: the former are challenged with the cartoon images directly, while the latter are given multifaceted descriptions of the visual scene to simulate human-level visual understanding. We find that both types of models struggle at all three tasks. For example, our best multimodal models fall 30 accuracy points behind human performance on the matching task, and, even when provided ground-truth visual scene descriptors, human-authored explanations are preferred head-to-head over the best machine-authored ones (few-shot GPT-4) in more than 2/3 of cases. We release models, code, leaderboard, and corpus, which includes newly-gathered annotations describing the image\u2019s locations/entities, what\u2019s unusual in the scene, and an explanation of the joke.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\n_Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind._\n\n- White, E. B. (1941)\n\nEach week, _The New Yorker_ publishes a uncaptioned cartoon image, inviting readers to submit their funniest English-language caption for it. Editors choose three finalists from sometimes thousands of submissions; then, readers vote to pick the final winner. We develop a suite of three progressively harder tasks built around this contest to test how well AI models \"understand\" humor across vision and language: 1) matching jokes to cartoons, 2) identifying a winning caption, and 3) generating an explanation of why an image/caption combination is funny.\n\nThese tasks are difficult because the connection between a winning caption and image can be quite subtle, and the caption can make playful allusions to human experience, culture, and imagination. Consider the image and winning caption \"Can you please pass the cow?\" in Figure 1. Unlike literal image captions such as in MSCOCO Lin et al. (2014), here, the caption's relation to the image is indirect:1 the size of the mugs must first be recognized as unusual, and then, the caption invokes\n\nFigure 1: We formulate three tasks using over a decade of New Yorker caption contests: models must 1) recognize a caption written about a cartoon (vs. options that were not); 2) evaluate that caption\u2019s \u201cquality\u201d by scoring it more highly than a non-finalist/non-winner from the same contest; and 3) explain why the joke is funny. (Cartoon by Drew Dernavich, winning caption by Bennett Ellenbogen).\n\nan association between a large mug and a large amount of cream/milk -- perhaps a whole cow's worth. Further, matching a caption to an image is not sufficient: non-finalist entries (e.g., \"...In-somniacs Anonymous\" in Figure 1) also match the image, but something else makes one seem funnier than the other. Finally, even if a model can accurately identify winning submissions, we would like it to also be able to explain _why_ a particular highly rated/relevant caption is funny.\n\nWe cover our three tasks in two settings: in the _from pixels_ setting, models are given access only to the cartoon images at test time, and must perform computer vision; in the _from description_ setting, we allow models access to a newly-collected, human-authored corpus of cartoon descriptions, thus simulating access to a human-level computer-vision system -- or, alternately, facilitating benchmarking of models that don't have a built-in image-processing component. The annotations we collect and release are rich and multifaceted: they describe the image overall and its locations and entities, what's unusual about the image, and an explanation of the joke. We view this effort as a significant contribution of our work.\n\nOur results reveal a gap between AI and human-level humor \"understanding.\" In the _from pixels_ setting, our best multimodal model (fine-tuned CLIP ViT-L/14 (Radford et al., 2021)) achieves 62% accuracy on a 5-way multiple choice task, but humans achieve 94% in the same setting. Even with significant manual annotation of the cartoons in the _from description_ setting (and despite significant improvements in language modeling performance since this work's submission2) large language models still fall short: human explanations are still preferred in more than two-thirds of cases compared to our best explanation model, 5-shot GPT-4.\n\nFootnote 2: GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) was the most performant in Jan. 2023 when this work was submitted, but we have since updated our results.\n\nWe release our challenging NLP/vision benchmarks,3 annotations, models, leaderboard, and code at [https://capcon.dev/](https://capcon.dev/). Beyond AI research, we also hope that our work will spur progress in human-AI collaboration tools for cartoonists, contest entrants, and beyond (see Appendix G for AI-generated captions).\n\nFootnote 3: Our data may contain offensive jokes. We manually removed a handful of cases we observed to target specific protected classes. We do not endorse the jokes in the corpus, but rather, view them as interesting objects of study.\n\n## 2 Datasets and Task Setups\n\nOur corpus compiles 14 years of weekly New Yorker caption contests. Each contest consists of: (1) a captionless cartoon; (2) that week's entries; (3) the three finalists, selected by New Yorker editors; and (4) for some contests, quality estimates for each submission collected via crowdsourcing.4\n\nFootnote 4: We regret that The New Yorker does not currently have an alliterative-paragraph contest.\n\nThe corpus was constructed from two sources. The first is Jain et al. (2020), from which we obtain roughly 250 contests (mean/median 6.1K/5.7K unique captions per contest; 1.5M total), starting from #508.5 Crowd ratings in this corpus are gath\n\nFigure 2: Instances of our three tasks. _Matching_ requires models to select the finalist caption for the given cartoon from among distractors that were finalists, but for _other_ contests. _Quality ranking_ requires models to differentiate a finalist from a non-finalist, both written for the given cartoon. _Explanation_ requires models to generate free-text explanations of how a high-quality caption relates to the cartoon. Cartoons by Robert Mankoff and Mick Stevens.\n\nered via the NEXT platform (Jamieson et al., 2015; Tanczos et al., 2017), where readers rate captions as \"funny\", \"somewhat funny\", or \"unfunny\"; we use the per-caption mean. There are over 114M ratings total (mean/median of 445K/471K per contest). We also sample three additional top captions that aren't editorial picks to serve as additional \"finalists.\"\n\nThe second corpus, due to Shahaf et al. (2015); Radev et al. (2016) and derived from contests #1-#507, includes 2M unique captions (mean/median 5.2K/5.0K per contest), but no crowd ratings. We remove by hand 55 contests whose images' resolutions are too low, and identify 80 low resolution (but usable) cases, taking special care when annotating this set (SS2.2).\n\n### Task Setups\n\nWe pose three tasks. Matching and explanation are novel, whereas quality ranking extends the formulations introduced in Shahaf et al. (2015); Radev et al. (2016).\n\nMatching._Can a model recognize when a caption is appropriate for a given cartoon?_ Five choices are given, only one of which truly corresponds. For the example in Figure 1, we supply the following possibilities:\n\n1. _O.K. I'm at the window. To the right? Your right or my right?_\n2. _I'd kill for some cream cheese._\n3. _Bob just came directly from work._\n4. **Can you please pass the cow?**\n5. _They only allow one carry-on._\n\nThe correct caption is a finalist for the cartoon. Negative choices are randomly selected finalists from other contests, and as a result, are great captions for some _other_ contest's image.6 In some cases, matching depicted objects to their textual references may suffice, but in other cases, the relationship is more indirect. For example, Figure 2 (top) contains a subtle reference to Jane Goodall, thus requiring external knowledge; Figure 2 (bottom) relies on a stereotype of pharmaceutical companies being untrustworthy, hence requiring reasoning beyond the literal text.\n\nFootnote 6: Distractors are balanced across instances so that a model that only examines the answer choices cannot achieve better than chance accuracy.\n\nQuality ranking._Can a model identify highly rated captions?_ For each finalist, we sample for comparison a caption that was _not_ selected as a finalist, and ask models to identify which one (the real one or the distractor) was rated as higher quality. As preprocessing, we run one round of text-only filtering to discard submissions that are easily identifiable as low quality, and also perform semantic deduplication; more details in Appendix C. Here is the end result for Figure 1:\n\n1. **Can you please pass the cow?**\n2. Welcome to Insomniacs Anonymous.\n\nWhich caption a particular individual prefers can be a matter of personal taste; but there is a general preference among our human annotators for the true finalist (see SS3).\n\nExplanation._Can a model generate as good an explanation as a human for why a caption-and-image combination is funny?_ Free-form explanations of why captions are funny/appropriate for their corresponding image were written by an author of this paper.7 The rough annotation guidance was: \"In a few sentences, explain the joke as if to a friend who doesn't 'get it' yet.\" Starting from a random finalist for each contest, after filtering out cases where the author did not understand the joke, a corpus of 651 human-created joke explanations to serve as comparison points was formed (mean/median 60/59 words, 39.3K total). We consider a model to succeed at this task if human judges, presented with (unlabeled) pairs of author/machine-generated explanations, do not show a preference for the author-generated ones.\n\nFootnote 7: Several attempts to solicit explanations from crowdworkers were not satisfactory; similarly unsuccessful were prompting experiments with GPT-3 inspired by Wiegreffe et al. (2022); Marasovi\u0107 et al. (2022) \u2014 too few of the sampled explanations were correct to bootstrap a corpus.\n\nEvaluation metrics.For matching and quality ranking, we evaluate using accuracy. For quality ranking, we report _NYAcc_ -- the average accuracy over instances where the finalist was an official New Yorker finalist -- and _CrowdAcc_, where the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\hline \\hline \\# Train/val/test Matching & 1.6K / 538 / 538 \\\\ \\# Train/val/test Quality ranking & 1.6K / 523 / 523 \\\\ \\# Train/val/test Explanation & 391 / 130 / 130 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Basic size statistics for our three tasks. We extend Shahaf et al. (2015); Radev et al. (2016); Jain et al. (2020) by (a) proposing matching, quality ranking, and explanation tasks; (b) providing new, dense annotations for each cartoon (see Figure 3); (c) authoring a set of 651 joke explanations.\n\n\"finalist\" caption was selected by the crowd as high quality. These two measures allow us to account for different audience tastes. For explanation, we conduct pairwise human evaluations to test several hypotheses detailed in SS3.2. To complement these human evaluations, we also report in Appendix E automatic metrics that take into account the human-written reference: (a) BLEU-4 Papineni et al. (2002) using Post (2018)+ROUGE-L Lin (2004); and (b) word-level perplexity.\n\nFrom Pixels + From Description.We consider two experimental settings. In **From Pixels (FP)**, a vision+language model undertakes image processing, i.e., at test time, the only contest information available is the image itself. In the second setting, which we call **From Description (FD)**, we factor out visual processing by providing the model with human written annotations, described in SS2.2. FD models thus simulate access to a human-level computer-vision system.\n\n### Annotation of cartoons.\n\nWe collect several types of annotations about the 704 cartoons; these either serve as input to models in the _from description_ setting, or as additional information available only at training time in the _from pixels_ setting. For each cartoon, we gather:\n\n1. A phrase describing the setting of the scene, e.g., \"an office\" or \"the park\" (2 per cartoon)\n2. A literal 1-3 sentence description of the scene (3 per cartoon)\n3. A 1-3 sentence description or explanation of what makes the scene unusual (3 per cartoon)\n4. 2-3 English Wikipedia links that an annotator identified as relevant, to serve as a proxy for world knowledge (2 per cartoon)\n\nA random sample of annotations is shown in Figure 3. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk, and paid crowdworkers a minimum of $15/hr. Low-resolution images involved special treatment: 1) we offered additional pay to crowdworkers; and 2) at least one of the annotations is conducted by an author of this work using the same HIT interface. Details including qualification rounds, screenshots of the HITs, etc. are given in Appendix A.\n\n## 3 Experiments\n\nWe split the 704 cartoons into 5 cross-validation splits such that entire contests are held out at test time. Task construction details are in Appendix C; modeling details (e.g., hyperparameter sweeps, task formatting) are in Appendix B.\n\n### From Pixels (FP) Models\n\nWe explore two vision+language models.\n\nClip.We fine-tune CLIP ViT-L/14@366px Radford et al. (2021) (428M parameters), which consists of a text Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017) and a vision Transformer Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) pretrained to align images/captions in the WebImageText corpus (400M pairs). For multiple choice, we use InfoNCE Oord et al. (2018) to encourage the cosine similarity of the cartoon/correct answer to be higher than the incorrect ones. For zero-shot classification, we use the prompt a new yorker cartoon with\n\nFigure 3: For each of 704 cartoons, we gather several types of annotations from human participants, including locations, descriptions, descriptions of uncanniness, and relevant entities in the form of English Wikipedia links. Annotations shown are true random samples from the corpus. Cartoons by Mark Thompson and Will McPhail.\n\nwinning caption. CLIP isn't generative, so we can't use it for explanation.\n\nOfa \\(\\rightarrow\\) Lm.We use OFA Huge (930M parameters) (Wang et al., 2022), a seq2seq model that supports image/text inputs/outputs; it is pretrained on a variety of vision+language tasks. We fine-tune on the New Yorker corpus by training it to map from (cartoon, prompt) \\(\\rightarrow\\) descriptions for the four types of annotations described in SS2.2; see Figure 4 for example predictions. We organize the OFA-predicted outputs in the same format as the human-authored descriptions in our From Description (FD) models detailed below (except the inputs are the outputs of OFA), and pass the result to a language model:8 this composition can be considered a Socratic Model (Zeng et al., 2022).\n\nFootnote 8: We found that fine-tuning OFA directly was less effective.\n\n### From Description (FD) Models\n\nWe formulate multiple-choice tasks as text-to-text by concatenating the human-authored cartoon descriptions with the choices as input: the target is simply the letter corresponding to the answer, e.g., E. For explanation, we autoregressively generate the explanations conditioned on the descriptions/captions.\n\nT5.We fine-tune T5-Large and T5-11B (Raffel et al., 2020); these encoder-decoder transformer models have 770M and 11.3B parameters respectively. For explanation, we sample with temperature 1.0 and nucleus sampling with p=95 (Holtzman et al., 2020).\n\nGpt-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4.We use these three OpenAI models as both zero-shot and few-shot models. We provide the models with a description of the task, and, for the few-shot case, 5 random labelled in-context examples. Specifically, for GPT-3 we use text-davinci-002 (175B) (Brown et al., 2020), and for GPT-3.5/GPT-4, we use the May 12, 2023 versions (OpenAI, 2023). For GPT-3, we also consider a fine-tuned version (which is unavailable for GPT3.5/GPT-4).9 For zero-shot GPT-3.5/GPT-4, early experiments revealed that prompting models to \"think\" step-by-step with chain-of-thought (CoT) was helpful (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022). See SSB.6 for GPT-3 details, and SSB.7 for GPT-3.5/GPT-4 details.\n\nFootnote 9: [https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning); for explanation, we use the default settings; for multiple choice, we set prompt_loss_weight to zero. The validation set is not used by the API for early stopping, so we concatenate it with the training set and perform no validation.\n\n### Baselines\n\nCaption Only.In addition to a **Random**-guess baseline, we fine-tune T5-11B given just the caption, i.e., without knowledge of the cartoon (Trichelair et al., 2019; Poliak et al., 2018).\n\nHuman performance estimates.Three people (two authors and one person familiar with the project) each attempted 100 randomly sampled instances from both the matching and quality ranking tasks.10 It is important to note that _human performance is not an upper bound for model performance on matching and quality ranking_ because labels are not generated by a single human and tastes can vary; it can (and does, see SS3.1) happen that a machine might be able to reconstruct New Yorker editor preferences more reliably than an untrained human. Annotators were given access to the images, but not the descriptions (akin to the FP setting).\n\nFootnote 10: Matching instances were sampled such that there were no repeated options, i.e., annotators couldn\u2019t use process of elimination across instances. 595 total responses were collected.\n\nHardware+software details.T5, CLIP, and OFA were trained using 8 A100 GPUs in pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019). We use the Transformers (Wolf et al., 2020) implementation of T5: T5-11B was trained with deepspeed (Rasley\n\nFigure 4: Example predictions by fine-tuned OFA-Huge from images. The model recognizes many objects/actions/locations, but makes some mistakes (indicated in red): for the left image, for example, it falsely indicates that the cat is smoking, and, on the right, that the mice are small people or hamsters (hamsters have stubby tails). Cartoons by Farley Katz and Paul Noth.\n\net al., 2020); T5-Large and CLIP were trained with Accelerate.11\n\nFootnote 11: [https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate)\n\n### Matching and quality ranking results\n\nTable 2 contains the results. Among the _from description_ models, GPT-4 (5-shot) generally performs best, e.g., achieving 84.5% accuracy on matching. It (and fine-tuned GPT-3) also perform _better_ at predicting New Yorker editor selections than our three humans (column NYAcc: GPT-3 69.8 vs. Human estimate, 64.6), but underperform at predicting crowd selections (CrowdAcc column: GPT-4 73.3 vs. 83.7).12 We also see that our _from pixels_ models leave significant headroom compared to the human performance estimates.\n\nFootnote 12: Also, crowd selectors greatly outnumber New Yorker editors, so crowd rankings may be a more dependable target, statistically speaking.\n\nOther observations include: 1) both _from pixels_ and _from description_ models mostly outperform the Caption Only baseline (even for smaller model sizes), suggesting that the models are truly using feature interactions between cartoons/captions to improve their predictive accuracy; 2) fine-tuning CLIP tends to do best for matching in the _from pixels_ setting, but OFA+T5-11B is competitive for quality ranking (and supports generation, see SS3.2); and 3) the performance difference between T5 vs. OFA\\(\\rightarrow\\)T5 exemplifies the effect of suboptimal visual recognition when shifting from the _from pixels_ setting to the _from description_ setting. Finally, while performance drops are incurred universally for zero-shot models, pointing towards the utility of the new annotated corpus we are releasing (SS2.2), GPT-4's zero-shot chain-of-thought incurs a smaller performance drop compared to other zero-shot models; see SSB.7 for a sample chain-of-thought.\n\n### Human evaluation of explanation.\n\nWe gather judgments from 3 crowd-workers per test instance by asking them which of a pair of explanations they prefer, and take a majority vote to determine a winner. Results and annotator agreement are in Table 3, and samples of GPT-3, GPT-4, and human joke explanations are in Figure 5. Our evaluations address seven questions:\n\n**Q1: Do models utilize the image context of the caption to generate better explanations?**_Test: T5-11B vs. Caption-only T5-11B_. Answer: **Yes.** Compared to the same model trained with no access to image information, the model with image information wins in 84.7% of cases.\n\n**Q2: Is computer vision a bottleneck for top-quality explanation generation?**_Test: T5-11B (in the FD setting) vs. OFA \\(\\rightarrow\\) T5-11B_. Answer: **Yes.** Compared to the same model trained with access to human written descriptions available at test\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l c c c}  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Matching} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Quality Ranking} \\\\ \\cline{3-5}  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Accuracy (\\(\\uparrow\\))} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{CrowdAcc (\\(\\uparrow\\))} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{NYAcc (\\(\\uparrow\\))} \\\\ \\hline  & Random & 20.0 & 50.0 & 50.0 \\\\  & Caption Only (T5-11B) & 19.4 & 59.4 & 64.5 \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{l}{CLIP YIT-11A@36px (finetuned)} & 62.3 & 57.0 & 66.9 \\\\ \\(\\sharp\\) & \\(\\downarrow\\) Zero-shot & \\(\\downarrow\\) & 56.6 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 55.8 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 56.8 \\\\ \\(\\sharp\\) & OFA-Huge \\(\\rightarrow\\) T5-Large & 45.2 & 59.1 & 64.3 \\\\  & OFA-Huge \\(\\rightarrow\\) T5-11B & 51.8 & 60.3 & 65.0 \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{l}{TS-Large} & 59.6 & 61.8 & 64.8 \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{TS-11B} & 70.8 & 62.3 & 65.6 \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{GPT3-175B (finetuned)} & 75.1 & 64.8 & **69.8** \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\(\\downarrow\\) 5-shot} & \\(\\downarrow\\) & 57.2 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 55.1 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 54.8 \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\(\\downarrow\\) Zero-shot} & \\(\\downarrow\\) & 51.6 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 56.2 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 55.6 \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\(\\downarrow\\) Zero-shot} & \\(\\downarrow\\) & 50.4 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 52.8 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 55.4 \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\(\\downarrow\\) Zero-shot} & \\(\\downarrow\\) & **84.5** & **73.3** & 68.2 \\\\ \\multicolumn{5}{l}{\\(\\downarrow\\) Zero-shot+CGT} & \\(\\downarrow\\) & 81.9 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 66.2 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 64.3 \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{l}{Human Estimate From Fixels (FP)} & 94.0 & 83.7 & 64.6 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Prediction results for the matching and quality ranking tasks: averages over 5 cross-validation splits. Underlined results are the best model in the _From Fixels_ (FP) setting, where at test time, models only have access to the cartoon images. **Bold** results are best in the _From Description_ (FD) setting, where at test time, models have access to human-authored descriptions of the cartoons.

Q1-Q7 notations refer to the corresponding paragraphs in \u00a73.2.\n\nbetter on automatic evaluation metrics for explanation like BLEU-4 and Rouge-L (see Appendix E), which suggest that the earlier family of may fit the surface features of the generation task more effectively, e.g., 5-shot GPT-3 achieves 5.07 BLEU-4 compared to 4.99 for 5-shot GPT-4. This suggests that mirroring the surface form of our explanation corpus is not sufficient to generate the highest quality explanations.\n\n**Q7: Does our best model, GPT-4, explain jokes as well as humans?**_Test: Human vs. Few-shot GPT-4._ Answer: **No.** Human-written explanations are preferred by annotators in 68% of pairwise cases.14 We qualitatively examine the 39/130 cases where the human reference receives 3/3 annotator votes. In these cases, the machine-generated explanations usually incorrectly interpret the image, e.g., in one case, a caption jokes about two cavepeople in a hole looking at a caveman in a cave with the caption \"Personally, I'm not a big fan of modern architecture.\"; GPT-4 incorrectly interprets the hole as \"modern architecture\" instead of the cave. We also examine the 8/130 cases where the GPT-4 produced caption was unanimously preferred: a close reading of these cases is provided in Appendix F. In 3 of these 8 cases, the human explanations, while on the right track, had slight inaccuracies, and in the remaining 5 cases, the human and machine explanations both express the same idea, but with different styles (GPT-4's sometimes arguably being more formal, detailed, or fluent).\n\nFootnote 14: For a similar, earlier set of experiments with FT-GPT-3 vs. human, human was preferred in 87.8% of pairwise cases.\n\n### Error Analysis for Matching\n\nWe conduct an error analysis of a performant _from pixels_ model (CLIP ViT-L/14@336px fine-tuned), and a performant _from description_ model (GPT3-175B finetuned). We concatenate the test set predictions over the 5 cross validation splits, and ask:\n\n**Q8: Are some contests more difficult than others?** Answer: **Yes.**_Details:_ We conduct a \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test by forming a contest-by-correctness (704-by-2) contingency table, aggregating over the 3-6 matching instances for each contest, and find that errors are clustered according to contest (\\(p<.05\\) for both CLIP and GPT-3).15 There's a moderate Spearman correlation between the per-contest accuracy between the models (\\(\\rho=.28,p\\ll.001\\)), but (as a null hypothesis) only a slight correlation between contest date and difficulty for either (later contests easier, GPT3/CLIP \\(\\rho=.07/.08,p=.08/.05\\)). When the models' predictions agree, they are correct 87% of the time. When GPT-3 is wrong, CLIP is right only 38% of the time; under the null hypothesis that their errors are uncorrelated, CLIP's accuracy would be 62% (\\(p\\ll.001\\) errors are uncorrelated, permutation test). However, when we attempt to identify consistent factors that predict contest difficulty using various visual/linguistic predictors, we find hard vs. easy difficult to predict _a priori_; our best classifiers perform only slightly above random. We will distribute the hard vs. easy contest lists as a resource for future work.\n\nFootnote 15: Similar \\(\\chi^{2}\\) tests find no evidence of correlation between correctness and (a) cross-validation split (5-by-2 table; p=.84/.14 for GPT3/CLIP); or (b) which captions are randomly assigned as negative choices (2646-by-2 table, p=.92/.79 for GPT3/CLIP).\n\n## 4 Related Work\n\nHumor.Raskin (1979) and Attardo (2008) highlight three \"great families\" of theories of the roots of humor: 1) _hostility,_ claims of superiority over someone or something (Gruner, 1978; Billig, 2005); 2) _release_ of a constraint (Freud, 1905; Fry, 1963; Mindess, 1971) and 3) _incongruity,_ (sometimes \"incongruity-resolution\"; Mulder and Nijholt, 2002) the introduction (and subsequent resolution) of generally incompatible contexts (Schopenhauer, 1818; Shultz, 1976). Shahaf et al. (2015) note that most New Yorker caption contest cartoons involve incongruous situations.\n\nNLP + The Caption Contest.King et al. (2013), Shahaf et al. (2015), and Radev et al. (2016) analyze 5, 16, and 50 New Yorker Caption Contests, respectively. Best-performing features for identifying the funniest among a set of caption choices include: perplexity, match to image setting and uncanniness description, readability, proper nouns (Shahaf et al., 2015), overlap with WordNet's (Fellbaum, 1998) \"person\" and \"relative\" synsets, lexical centrality among submissions (Radev et al., 2016, inspired by Mihalcea and Pulman (2009)), and sentiment (both papers). Our \"location\" and \"uncanny description\" annotations are direct analogs of the \"context\" and \"anomaly\" tags of Shahaf et al. (2015), and our data incorporates that generously released by the previous researchers. Our extensions are (a) the addition of two novel tasks; (b) using new data/resources/models to curate ranking pairs (seeSS2); and (c) evaluating two distinct audience preferences: New Yorker editors vs. \"the crowd\". Appendix H highlights efforts beyond the scope of peer reviewed AI venues, e.g., blog posts.\n\nMeasuring preferences over captions.While humor is ultimately subjective, work on the contest has studied modeling _average_ preferences of raters. Tanczos et al. (2017) design quality ranking algorithms for the caption contest, framed as identifying the best \"arm\" in a multi-armed bandit setting; their crowdsourcing system NEXT Jamieson et al. (2015) is used by The New Yorker. It does not directly use the content of the cartoons/contests. The result is Jain et al. (2020)'s continuously updated corpus, from which we draw some of our data.\n\nMultimodal and computational humor.Chandrasekaran et al. (2016) explore humor recognition in images, and Castro et al. (2019); Hasan et al. (2019); Patro et al. (2021); Hasan et al. (2021) explore laughter prediction in TED-talks/sitcoms. Tsakona (2009); Fallianda et al. (2018) study political cartoons. Chakrabarty et al. (2022) recently proposed a version of NLI for figurative language, which can be humorous. Some work has tried to detect whether a sentence is humorous or not Blinov et al. (2019); Annamoradnejad and Zoghi (2020). More difficult to evaluate Valitutti (2011) are setups where the goal is to automatically generate humorous content in various contexts Binsted and Ritchie (1994); Stock and Strapparava (2003); Mihalcea and Strapparava (2005); Wang and Wen (2015); Chandrasekaran et al. (2018); Yoshida et al. (2018); Sundaram (2018); Shimomoto et al. (2019); a survey is provided by Amin and Burghardt (2020).\n\nExplaining humor.In the taxonomy of Tan (2022), joke explanations are most related to proximal mechanisms: \"This type of explanation attempts to provide the mechanism behind the predicted label, i.e., how to infer the label from the text\", or efficient cause a la Aristotle Lombrozo (2006). Chowdhery et al. (2022) undertake a qualitative exploration of (non-visual) joke explanations.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe demonstrate that today's vision and language models still cannot recognize caption relevance, evaluate (at least in the sense of reproducing crowdsourced rankings), or explain The New Yorker Caption Contest as effectively as humans can. However, the partial capacity of today's AI is still substantial, and may be sufficient for models to serve as creative collaborators, e.g., as brainstorming assistants for humorists/cartoonists. Specifically: 1) our matching/quality ranking models could help entrants receive quantitative feedback on the relevance/predicted quality of their submissions, and 2) the annotated corpus+explanations we introduce could be repurposed for generation (we explore generation of novel cartoons/captions in Appendix G). Finally, a promising avenue for future work focused on generating humorous captions (c.f. our focus of humor \"understanding\" benchmarks) would be to operationalize the feedback provided by our matching/ranking models in an reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) loop.\n\nA last remark.We cannot claim to know whether the human-machine 'humor understanding gap' will be closed sooner or later.16 But we encourage other researchers to have as much fun with the topic as we did!\n\nFootnote 16: Or never. Is never good for you?\n\n## 6 Limitations\n\nThe New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest represents a narrow slice of humor, deriving from a particular language, region, history, culture, style, and set of conventions. Hence, the results of this study do not represent or cover all types of humor.\n\nOur framing of the quality ranking task could be interpreted as seemingly prescriptive (i.e., that joke A is \"objectively\" better than joke B), but New Yorker editorial selections should not be taken as ground truth for funniness; disagreement about what is funny is expected and valid. Our tasks operationalize the prediction of only _average_ preferences (rather than individual ones), and these preferences may include a partiality or bias towards items that conform to the characteristics of prior contest winners or published New Yorker cartoons.\n\nFinally, the explanations in our annotated corpus were largely written by a single author of this paper. While a larger pool of the crowdworkers judged these explanations to be of higher quality in comparison to machine generations, future work would be well-suited to compare the person-to-person variance in explaining why particular jokes are funny.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the cartoonists and contest entrants for their wonderful efforts!

We ran this HIT 2.7K times to facilitate the comparisons in SS3.2\n\nQualification+training rounds.To ensure our set of crowdworkers were properly trained for the annotations, we ran two types of qualification rounds: one for the description/link HITs, and one for the pairwise explanation HITs.\n\nFor the description/link HITs, our qualification round was based off an earlier and more involved HIT that involved a joint setup where, for 3 cartoons, users described cartoons, highlighted image regions, explained jokes, etc. We allowed users from {AU, CA, NZ, GB, US} with 10K prior approved HITs and a minimum acceptance rate of 97% on their previous HITs to participate. Some of the cartoons and captions contain mature themes; we provided the recommended disclaimer for this and other HITs: \"WARNING: This HIT may contain adult content. Worker discretion is advised.\" We manually graded the responses of 30 annotators in a qualification round, and qualified 21. Through a mix of the older, more involved HITs and the streamlined HIT in Figure 6, which is a pared-down version of the original HIT without captions, we gathered descriptions of the cartoons. We also gathered the locations/Wikipedia entity links from the qualified annotators. These annotations were gathered in mid-to-late 2021.\n\nAbout 9 months later, we conducted a second set of Mechanical Turk studies for pairwise judgment evaluations for explanation. A second qualification round was run, in which we asked annotators to rate the quality of several joke explanations which we manually selected to be good/bad across various desirable axes. We qualified 29 out of 51 annotators who attempted the HIT via manual inspection of their responses. This set of annotators were given access to the final pairwise-judgment HITs.\n\nCrowdworking studies of standard computer vision corpora (involving no personal disclosures) are not required by our IRB to be reviewed by them. While the authors of this work are not lawyers and this is not legal advice, this opinion is based on United States federal regulation 45 CFR 46, under which this study qualifies and as exempt. We hashed crowdworker IDs in the public release so annotations cannot be back-traced to individual workers.\n\n## Appendix B Additional Experimental Details\n\n### From Description details\n\nFor each cartoon, we have multiple annotations of each type, as detailed in SS2.2. During training, we utilize all location/description/uncanny description/sets of links, but at test time, we randomly sample a single set of these four annotation types such that inference requires only a single forward pass. For fair comparison, the randomly sampled description available at test time is held constant between all methods.\n\nMore detail about how we managed multiple annotations: because we have 2 locations \\(\\times\\) 3 descriptions \\(\\times\\) 3 uncanny descriptions \\(\\times\\) 2 entity links, there are potentially 36 possible combinations we could use to form a _from description_ instance for each cartoon. However: tuples are constructed at the annotator level to account for potential dependencies between annotation types: because descriptions/uncanny descriptions were were collected in the same HIT, the uncanny description may reference entities from the description because they were authored at the same time by the same annotator in sequence. Similarly, the (locations, links) were collected in the same HIT. So, we instead consider all six possible tuples holding author constant between HITs, i.e., 3 (description, uncanny description) \\(\\times\\) 2 (location, link). For test time, select a single random valid tuple of annotations for evaluation, which is fixed for all comparisons.\n\n### Clip\n\nFor fine-tuning results, we do linear warmup for 200 steps and conduct a small learning rate search on the validation set for each cross-validation split independently between \\(\\{5e{\\text{-}}5,1e{\\text{-}}5,5e{\\text{-}}6\\}\\), keeping batch size fixed at 32. To keep the entire cartoon in the 336px square input, we resize and pad. At training time, we perform data augmentations on the image, including: random horizontal flipping, random color jittering, and random grayscaling.\n\n**NOTE: The instructions have probably changed since the last time you did this HIT while this HIT is similar, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the modifications**\n\n**Your task is to analyze a given image.**\n\n**There are three parts**\n\n**First, describe the literal contents of the image image by writing a 2-3 sentence summary. Consider focusing on:**\n\n**Where is the scene taking place?**\n\n**What is the scene? What are they doing?**\n\n**What objects and actors are being depicted?**\n\n**Is anyone particularly happy/unhappy/mind/etc.?**\n\n**There is no need to be too formal, but please do your best to write full, grammatical sentences (see the examples below).**\n\n**Second, these images may depict interesting/unusual situations. Highlight these uncanny/unusual elements, by giving a 1-2 sentence explanation of why they are uncanny, e.g., \"playeucharacter,\" 1/3 unusual/unhappy/out-of-piece became...\". Consider focusing on:**\n\n**Which objects, actions, entities, etc are out-of-place and why?**\n\n**Are the actions any characters are undertaking strange?**\n\n**Do the characters have any unusual identifying characteristic?**\n\n**Third, in a single sentence, please write the question that you most want answered about the scene, based on the image, your description, and your highlight of which parts are unusual/unhappy (see examples below). Optionally, you can include a second question that you would like answered if there are multiple uncanny elements to the scene.**\n\n**Please describe the literal contents of the image in 2-3 sentences:**\n\n_A man in a suit is lying down on a sidewalk in a busy city as pedestrians walk over him. The pedestrians seem to be frustrated and confused that the lying down man is blocking their way, while the man himself seems to be concrete._\n\n**Please highlight/explain any unusual/out-of-place elements in 1-2 sentences:**\n\n_It's unusual that the man is lying in the middle of a sidewalk not only because this action is disruptive to other pedestrians, but also because he's in a nice suit that is likely to become dirty. Furthermore, his cartee expression indicates that, despite these downsides, he doesn't care and is in no rash to move._\n\n**In 1 sentence, which question would you most like answered about the scene?**\n\n**Why is the man lying on the sidewalk?**\n\n**Figure 6: Instructions, example, and interface for the Cartoon Description HIT. We gather, but do not use, the final \u201cWhich question?\u201d annotation in our experiments.**\nIn this first, you will be presented with a cartoon from the New Yorker, and a caption someone wrote about that cartoon. The captions will relate to the image in a drawthrough way.\n\nYou will also be presented with **two explanations** of the jazz: these explanations may be written by humans or by machines. Your job is to **select the explanation that you think in the best one**.\n\nAside from fluency, grammaticality, etc., qualities of good explanations include:\n\n* they offer a complete explanation of why the caption is funny;\n* they reference appropriate external factors for less-world knowledge, etc;\n* they are not very long or overly short.\n* they are not overly frequent!\n* they are not overly frequent!\n* they, they don't contain false information, e.g., references to objects, people, etc. that are not in the image.\n\nIf both explanations are reasonable, choose the one you prefer. If both explanations are bad, do you best, and choose the one that is less-unyariness more correct references.\n\nPlease take a moment to understand the explanations\u2014 some can be hard to understand! Choices for explanations will appear after a ten second delay.\n\nThanks again for your participation and your word!\n\nFigure 8: Instructions and interface for the pairwise explanation judgment HIT.\n\nFigure 7: Instructions and example for the Wikipedia links HIT.\n\n### Ofa\n\nWe use validation-set early stopping on cross-entropy loss, and fine-tune OFA separately for each cross-validation split. After fine-tuning, we select the top-1 prediction according to beam search (n=5). We finetune OFA Huge with a learning rate of \\(5e\\)-\\(5\\), which was determined via a small grid search over the first cross-validation split. We use label-adjusted smoothed cross entropy loss as implemented by the OFA authors17 with smoothing of 0.1. We train for a maximum of 7 epochs with a warmup ratio of 6%. For each image, we query for the four different types of annotations shown in Figure 3. To facilitate this, in addition to providing OFA with the image, we also provide it with a per-annotation-type prompt:\n\nFootnote 17: [https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFA)\n\n1. for locations: \"Where does this take place?\"\n2. for descriptions: \"Describe this image.\"\n3. for uncanny: \"What's unusual about this image?\"\n4. for entities: \"What entities are there?\"\n\nIn early experiments, instead of composing with a language model, we did attempt to fine-tune OFA directly for the explanation task. However, we found that the resulting perplexity (roughly 300) was significantly higher than for other fine-tuned models, with the errors difficult to diagnose.\n\n### T5-Large/T5-11b.\n\nFor T5-Large, we conduct a small, per-cross-validation split learning rate search between \\(\\{1e\\)-\\(4,1e\\)-\\(5,5e\\)-\\(5\\}\\) and keep batch size fixed at 64. For T5-11B we use a fixed learning rate of \\(1e\\)-\\(5\\) and a batch size of 64.\n\n### GPT-3 Zero Shot/In Context\n\nWe use GPT-3's davinci-text-002 model for our main zero shot and in-context learning experiments. Examples of zero-shot prompts for all tasks are given in Figure 9. The in-context prompts are similar, except they contain 5 random samples from the training set. A full, randomly selected in-context prompt for the explanation generation task is given in Figure 10.\n\n### GPT-3 Fine-tuning\n\nWe use the OpenAI fine-tuning API to fine-tune davinci, a 175B parameter language model.18 While the precise details of how the API works are not currently available (e.g., which parameters are updated, or which version of davinci is used), we use the same cross-validation setup as for the other models so that the results are comparable. The total fine-tuning cost is approximately (3 tasks) \\(\\times\\) (5 cross-val splits) \\(\\times\\) (40 dollars per fine-tune) = 600 dollars.\n\nFootnote 18: [https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning)\n\n### GPT 3.5/GPT-4 Details\n\nBetween submitting this work and its acceptance, OpenAI released two new models, GPT-3.5 (sometimes called ChatGPT when accessed through the chat interface) and GPT-4; we updated our results to include these models. Figure 11 provides an example of a prompt/response in the new \"Chat\" API, which requires a more structured conversational prompt compared to the GPT-3 \"Completion\" API; this prompt includes a \"system\" prompt, which describes the desired behavior of the model, e.g., \"You are CaptionContestGPT...\" We sample with default hyperparameters in all cases. The cost of GPT 3.5 is an order of magnitude less than GPT-4. In total our GPT-4 queries cost on the order of $4K.\n\n## Appendix C Task Construction Details\n\nIdentification of High Quality Captions.For each contest, our first step is to identify a set of high quality captions; these are involved in construction of instances for all three tasks. For cases where we have access to the three official New Yorker finalists, all are automatically added to the high quality set. Next, for cases where we have crowd ratings, we consider the top 5 crowd ranked captions according to the mean score provided by Jain et al. (2020). From these top 5, we select 3 diverse candidates among these using a semantic deduplication method: specifically, we compute the SBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) vector for each candidate using paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2, compute a hierarchical clustering of the candidates, and sample a single candidate from each cluster -- the result is a set of candidates that is representative of all clusters. In total, there are 2.7K high quality captions across 704 contests. Each contest either has 3 high quality captions (coming from the official New Yorker finalists or, if those aren't available, highly crowd-rated options), or 6 (if both official finalists and crowd rated are available).\n\nForning Matching Instances.For each high quality caption, we create a matching instance that serves as the correct answer. Next, we randomly assign captions to mismatched contests to form negative, mismatched sets to serve as false options. While the assignment is random, we have two constraints: 1) we assign within cross-validation splits only, to ensure that training/validation/testing captions are disjoint; and 2) we construct the corpus with no answer-only biases by performing the negative assignment such that each answer appears exactly once as a correct answer and exactly 4 times as an incorrect answer in other instances.\n\nForning Quality ranking Instances.For each high quality caption, we aim to sample from the larger set of all submissions for the contest captions that are just \"okay.\" First, we note that 25 contests from early on in the contest's history were missing entries, so we are limited to sampling negatives for 679 contests. Next, because many entries are exact duplicates, we deduplicate on string matching, such that \"okay\" captions are not exact copies of 1) the identified high quality captions; and 2) any other sampled \"okay\" captions.\n\nNext, for later contests from Jain et al. (2020), we have estimated quality ratings based on crowd feedback for each entry already: in that case, we discard the top third and bottom third of captions according to mean crowd rating -- the middle tertile form the \"okay\" set we sample from.\n\nBut, for earlier contests, we do not have direct ratings: we only have access to New Yorker finalists and a large pool of entries. For those cases, we aim to eliminate captions that are clearly likely to be low quality. To accomplish this, we train a quality ranking model (conditioned just on the caption text, rather than any information about the contest) using crowdlabelled data from 253 contests provided by Jain et al. (2020). We sample a good/bad set by selecting from each contest the top and bottom 1000 entries according to their mean crowdsource score: the resulting dataset forms a corpus of 506K captions. We form two sets of labelled data based on the parity of the contest\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c}  & Matching & Quality Ranking & & Explanation \\\\ \\hline Accuracy (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & CrowdAcc (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & NYAcc (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & B-4 (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & Rouge-L (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & PPL (\\(\\downarrow\\)) \\\\ \\hline Random & 20.0 & 50.0 & 50.0 & - & - & - \\\\ Caption Only (T5-11B finetuned) & 19.4 & 59.4 & 64.5 & 3.61 & 17.8 & 34.0 \\\\ \\hline text-ada-001 (in context, n=5) & 20.1 & 50.8 & 49.9 & 2.04 & 15.9 & 2367 \\\\ text-babbage-001 (in context, n=5) & 19.0 & 51.3 & 51.1 & 2.18 & 17.2 & 137 \\\\ text-curie-001 (in context, n=5) & 20.4 & 51.0 & 50.0 & 2.99 & 18.1 & 108 \\\\ text-davinci-001 (in context, n=5) & 35.6 & 54.4 & 53.8 & 3.79 & 19.5 & 151 \\\\ text-davinci-002 (in context, n=5) & **57.2** & **55.1** & **54.8** & **5.07** & **20.5** & **107** \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: GPT-3 scaling experiment results, averaged over 5 cross-validation splits. In all cases, models are given access to the same sample of 5 in-context examples. Overall, text-davinci-002 performs best \u2014 this appears to be both because of scale (e.g., text-davinci-001 generally outperforms text-curie-001) and also because of training improvements in the updated 002 version of the model.\n\nFigure 9: Example GPT-3 zero-shot prompts for Matching (top) and Quality ranking (bottom) tasks. In-context prompts are similar, except 5 random labelled training examples are also provided in the prompt.\n\nIn this case, you will see a description of an auxiliary situation. There, you will see a pile that can within about the situation. Explain how the pile reflects to the situation and why it is.\n\nThis scene takes place in the following sections. A is in the third is sitting in a room with several muscles. Most are in steps, but one of them is in front of a typewriter IC's unusual to see a monkey operating a typewriter.

It appears to be harder to identify very good captions than very low rated ones: precision-at-10 is 77, precision-at-20 is 73, precision-at-30 is 70. Upon training these models, we perform inference on all captions in contests without crowd ratings, and discard the 25% of entries with the lowest predicted score. Entries with very low scores have some common characteristics, e.g., they don't have the _gestalt_ of a New Yorker caption, they have many typos/formatting issues, they include the contact information of the submitter, etc. Examples of discarded captions (some are obfuscated for privacy reasons) are:\n\n* THEY COULDN'T WAIT TO MARRY SO THEY CAME TO RECITE THEIR VOWS BETWEEN TAKES FROM \" PRIMITIVE LOVE LIFE\"\n* You're hurting me, will we ever break up?\" (@ technology)\n* The stressed is so \"Bad' in the world. \"you or me \" did not see(BIG ) (\"FOOT)\n* Too mammalian, needs reptile.\" [NAME], [STATE] [EMAIL]@gmail.com\n\nAfter identifying a set of captions that are not obviously bad, nor apparently among the top quality submissoins, our second step is to deduplicate entries. Because submitted captions for each contest are frequently identical to other submissions or play off the same core joke concept, we perform the same SBERT+hierarchical clustering semantic deduplication step as we did for sampling the diverse high quality set (described above). Specifically, we extract SentenceBERT embeddings [19] for each of the \\(N\\) entries, and then compute a hierarchical clustering of the embeddings into \\(.7\\cdot N\\) clusters, sampling only a single representitive from each cluster to form a less-redundant set. This removes 30% of the data with close neighbors in the final set: for example, for a contest depicting two monsters eating buildings in New York City, this step downsamples 100 \"tastes like chicken\" jokes (which end up in a single cluster) to a single exemplar.\n\nAfter filtering, for all contests, we are left with a (softly) deduplicated pool of candidate entries that are likely to be at least okay, but unlikely to be as good as the verifiably high quality entries. For each high quality entry, we sample an \"okay\" caption with: 1) similar estimated quality according to the text-only models; 2) similar length in words; 3) similar length in characters; 4) similar amount of punctuation; 5) a dissimilar SBERT embedding.\n\nExplanation corpus.After several attempts to solicit high-quality explanations from crowdworkers fell short, one of the authors of this paper decided to simply annotate a corpus of explanations themselves. For each contest, a high quality caption was sampled for annotation -- this high quality caption was sampled arbitrarily from the set of New Yorker finalists if they were available, and, in the few cases where New Yorker finalists weren't available, from the set of high quality crowd captions. Of the 704 sampled explanations, the author reported understanding 651 of them, and wrote an explanation for each. This was a substantial effort: the resulting corpus has a mean of 60 words of explanation per cartoon, and the total length, 39.3K words, is comparable in length to a novella.\n\n## Appendix D Graphical version of matching and ranking results.\n\nIn Figure 12, we use vertically-stacked bars to illustrate the difference between zero-shot (small dots), five-shot (vertical stripes), and fine-tuned (solid) versions of various models. Human results are set off by dark green lines.\n\nThe scatter-plot in Figure 13 uses the same graphical conventions to display the quality-ranking results. Recall our caveat that crowd accuracy may be more statistically reliable, in the sense that crowd selectors, whose tastes underlie the y-axis results, vastly outnumber New Yorker\n\nFigure 12: Graphical version of the matching results given in Table 2.\n\neditors, whose tastes underlie the x-axis results.\n\n## Appendix E Automatic evaluation of explanations\n\nFor completeness, we provide the results for automatically-calculated explanation-evaluation metrics in Table 5. (Log probabilities are unavailable for GPT-3.5/GPT-4 so we cannot report perplexity for them.) However, we believe that the human evaluations reported in the main body of the text are better quality measures.\n\n## Appendix F Machine explanations that were preferred over human ones\n\nGpt-4In 8/130 cases, for our human vs. GPT-4 5-shot experiments, the machine generation was preferred to the human reference by 3/3 annotators. In Figure 14 we conduct a close reading of these 8 instances to understand where the human references fell short. In all cases, both were topical, but, for a handful of cases, the machine generation is arguably better because it's more succinct, or offers a more meaningful detail.\n\nGpt-3We also include a close reading of several instances where a majority of annotators preferred GPT-3 annotations vs. our human ones. This occured in 16/131 cases for our human vs. GPT-3 experiments: in 15 cases, 2/3 annotators preferred the machine generation, and in 1 case, 3/3 annotators preferred the machine generation. We present a few examples of these cases with comments in Figure 15. Similar to GPT-4, most commonly, both the explanations were reasonable, in one case, the human-written explanation missed a pop culture reference to \"The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\" (1958) but GPT-3 mentions it. In six cases, we disagree with annotator consensus: the machine caption makes some correct references, but we believe it (sometimes subtly) misses the point.\n\n## Appendix G Aiding humor generation with system-assisted brainstorming\n\nOur main experiments focus on three tasks that probe machine capacity for matching, ranking, and explaining caption contest entries. But, given prior interest in generating caption entries, to provide a pointer towards more creative use cases, we developed a curated prompt that re-frames the corpus in a manner that enables the production of cartoon descriptions, concept brainstorming, and, ultimately, caption generation. In contrast to our existing annotations, we are inspired by Wallace (2022)'s framing, where free associations are used to connect-the-dots from cartoons to concepts to captions. So, for 9 finalist captions, we reverse-engineer a plausible brainstorming process that could have given rise to the caption by listing several potential associations from the scene, and, from that list, selecting the 1-3 that underpin the basis for the winning joke. In the end, our prompt consists of 9 examples formatted as:\n\n1. cartoon description (from our annotations)\n2. uncanny description (from our annotations)\n3. list of entities in scene (from our annotations)\n4. list of concepts from the cartoon that could be used for a caption (hand-designed for the\n\nFigure 13: Graphical version of the ranking results given in Table 2.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Explanation} \\\\ \\cline{3-5}  & & BLEU-4 (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & Rouge-L (\\(\\uparrow\\)) & PPL (\\(\\downarrow\\)) \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{5}{*}{\\begin{tabular}{} \\end{tabular} } & Caption Only (TS-11B) & 3.61 & 17.8 & 34.0 \\\\  & OFA-Huge \\(\\rightarrow\\) TS-Large & 3.36 & 17.5 & 50.7 \\\\  & OFA-Huge \\(\\rightarrow\\) TS-11B & 3.63 & 17.9 & 30.3 \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{5}{*}{\n\\begin{tabular}{} \\end{tabular} } & TS-Large & 3.54 & 18.2 & 41.2 \\\\  & T5-11B & 4.33 & 19.0 & 23.7 \\\\  & GPT3-175B (finetuned) & **5.42** & 20.1 & **21.8** \\\\  & \\(\\downarrow\\) 5-shot & \\(\\downarrow\\) 5.07 & \\(\\downarrow\\) **20.5** & \\(\\downarrow\\) 107 \\\\  & \\(\\downarrow\\) 2-Zero-shot & \\(\\downarrow\\) 3.12 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 18.8 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 225 \\\\  & GPT3.5 (5-shot) & 3.94 & 18.8 & - \\\\  & Zero-shot+Cor & \\(\\downarrow\\) 2.40 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 17.3 & - \\\\  & GPT4-(5-shot) & 4.99 & 20.0 & - \\\\  & \\(\\downarrow\\) 2-Zero-shot+Cor & \\(\\downarrow\\) 3.42 & \\(\\downarrow\\) 19.0 & - \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: Results for the explanation task using automatically computed metrics. Results are averages over 5 cross-validation splits. Underlined results are the best model in the _From Pixels_ (FP) setting, where at test time, models only have access to the cartoon images. **Bold** results are best in the _From Description_ (FD) setting, where at test time, models have access to human-authored descriptions of the cartoons.

But here, the company is trying to attract viewers \"50-feet-and-over\" -- the company is trying to attract the titular Attack of the 50-Foot-Woman (who is, indeed, over 50-feet-all).\n\nFigure 15: Examples of the small number of cases (16/131) where the machine-generated caption (fine-tuned GPT-3 175B) was preferred to the human-authored explanation by at least 2/3 annotators.\n\nFirst, you will see a description of a scene from a New Yorker cartoon that has an unusual and/or funny element. Our goal is to brainstorm a caption that we can enter into the caption context. The captions should be funny, and relate to the image. As part of this process, we will brainstorm about potential concepts from the cartoon, and then combine those concepts to make the caption. Finally, we will explain the caption, and how it relates to the scene.\n\nFigure 16: A portion of a 2,407 token prompt that re-formulates various annotations within our corpus in a format conducive for creative collaborations with a language model.

Generating line-by-line from this prompt could help to facilitate brainstorming for: unusual cartoon situations (first 4 lines), concepts about real or generated contexts that could serve as a basis for a humorous caption (line 5), and, captions themselves (lines 6-8). As a demonstration, we present an unconditional sample, in which the model describes a garden party where a chicken is playing croquet (cherry picked from 3 outputs; temperature=.8, top p=.9, frequency penalty=.2, presence penalty=.05), and also, a conditional sample, given a basic description of Contest #818\u2019s scene, which ran in mid-September 2022 (cherry picked from 5 outputs; same sampling parameters): the caption is arguably funny, but the explanation is not correct.\n\nprompt)\n5. a selected set of 1-3 ideas (selected from (4))\n6. caption (a finalist)\n7. explanation of the caption (from our annotations)\n\nA portion of our prompt is given in Figure 16, along with an unconditional generation (where the cartoon concept and caption are generated) and a conditional generation. Within 5 samples, GPT-3 invents a scene where a large chicken is playing croquet in a yard, and the caption: \"I'm not sure this is what they meant by free range.\" Also, when conditioned on a basic description of a real contest which depicts a large group of circus performers intruding on an unsuspecting person in their living room (Contest #181), it generates \"I'm never buying a timeshare again.\" Looking forward, we expect the matching/quality ranking models could be used in conjunction with this prompt to automatically filter for scene-specific generations with style similar to previous finalists.\n\n## Appendix H Related work beyond peer reviewed AI venues\n\nOutside of peer-reviewed NLP venues, several projects have used computational techniques to analyze the contest, usually with the goal of generating AI-assisted entries:\n\n* **The Pudding:** Mishkin et al.

In this paper, we perform a text-image attribution analysis on Stable Diffusion, a recently open-sourced model. To produce attribution maps, we upscale and aggregate cross-attention maps in the denoising module, naming our method DAAM. We validate it by testing its segmentation ability on nouns, as well as its generalized attribution quality on all parts of speech, rated by humans. On two generated datasets, we attain a competitive 58.8-64.8 mIoU on noun segmentation and fair to good mean opinion scores (3.4-4.2) on generalized attribution. Then, we apply DAAM to study the role of syntax in the pixel space across head\u2013dependent heat map interaction patterns for ten common dependency relations. We show that, for some relations, the head map consistently subsumes the dependent, while the opposite is true for others. Finally, we study several semantic phenomena, focusing on feature entanglement; we find that the presence of cohyponyms worsens generation quality by 9%, and descriptive adjectives attend too broadly. We are the first to interpret large diffusion models from a visuolinguistic perspective, which enables future research. Our code is at https://github.com/castorini/daam.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nDiffusion models trained on billions of captioned images represent state-of-the-art text-to-image generation (Yang et al., 2022), with some achieving photorealism, such as Google's Imagen (Sahara et al., 2022) and OpenAI's DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022). However, despite their quality and popularity, the dynamics of their image synthesis remain undercharacterized. Citing ethics, corporations have restricted the general public from using the models and their weights, preventing effective analysis. To overcome this barrier, Stability AI recently open-sourced Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), a 1.1 billion-parameter latent diffusion model pretrained and fine-tuned on the LAION 5-billion image dataset (Schuhmann et al., 2022).\n\nWe probe Stable Diffusion to provide insight into large diffusion models. Focusing on text-image attribution, our central question is, _\"How does an input word influence parts of a generated image?\"_ To this, we propose to produce 2D attribution maps for each word by combining cross-attention maps in the model. A related work in prompt-guided editing from Hertz et al. (2022) conjectures that per-head cross attention relates words to areas in Imagen-generated images, but they fall short of constructing global per-word attribution maps. We name our method diffusion attentive attribution maps, or \"DAAM;\" see Figure 1 for an example.\n\nTo evaluate the veracity of DAAM, we apply it to a semantic segmentation task (Lin et al., 2014) on generated imagery, comparing DAAM maps with annotation. We attain a 58.8-64.8 mean intersection over union (mIoU) score competitive with unsupervised segmentation models, described in Section 3.1. We further bolster these results using a generalized study covering all parts of speech (all in Penn Treebank; Marcinkiewicz, 1994), such as adjectives and verbs. Through human annotation, we show that the mean opinion score (MOS) is above fair to good (3.4-4.2) on interpretable words.\n\nNext, we study how relationships in the syntactic space of prompts relate to those in the pixel space\n\nFigure 1: The original synthesized image and three DAAM maps for \u201cmonkey,\u201d \u201chat,\u201d and \u201cwalking,\u201d from the prompt, \u201cmonkey with hat walking.\u201dof images. We assess head-dependent DAAM interactions across ten common syntactic relations (enhanced Universal Dependencies; Schuster and Manning, 2016), finding that, for some, the heat map of the dependent strongly subsumes the head's, while the opposite is true for others. For others, such as coreferent word pairs, the words' maps greatly overlap, indicating coreferent understanding during generation. We assign intuition to our observations; for example, we observe that the maps of verbs contain their subjects, suggesting that verbs strongly contextualize the generation of both the subjects and their surroundings.\n\nFinally, we form hypotheses to further our syntactic findings, studying semantic phenomena using DAAM, particularly those affecting image quality. In Section 5.1, we demonstrate that, in constructed prompts with two distinct nouns, cohyponyms have worse quality (9% worse than non-cohyponyms), e.g., \"a giraffe and a zebra\" generates a giraffe _or_ a zebra, but not both. Cohyponym status and generation incorrectness each increases the amount of heat map overlap, advancing DAAM's utility toward improving diffusion models. We also show in Section 5.2 that descriptive adjectives attend too broadly across the image, far beyond their nouns. If we fix the scene layout (Hertz et al., 2022) and vary only the adjective, the entire image changes, not just the noun. These two phenomena suggest feature entanglement, where objects are entangled with both the scene and other objects.\n\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows: **(1)** we propose and evaluate an attribution method, novel within the context of interpreting diffusion models, measuring which parts of the generated image the words influence most; **(2)** we provide new insight into how syntactic relationships map to generated pixels, finding evidence for directional imbalance in head-dependent DAAM map overlap, alongside visual intuition (and counterintuition) in the behaviors of nominals, modifiers, and function words; and **(3)** we shine light on failure cases in diffusion models, showing that descriptive adjectival modifiers and cohyponyms result in entangled features and DAAM maps.\n\n## 2 Our Approach\n\n### Preliminaries\n\nLatent diffusion models (Rombach et al., 2022) are a class of denoising generative models that are trained to synthesize high-fidelity images from random noise through a gradual denoising process, optionally conditioned on text. They generally comprise three components: a deep language model like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) for producing word embeddings; a variational autoencoder (VAE; Kingma and Welling, 2013) which encodes and decodes latent vectors for images; and a time-conditional U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015) for gradually denoising latent vectors. To generate an image, we initialize the latent vectors to random noise, feed in a text prompt, then iteratively denoise the latent vectors with the U-Net and decode the final vector into an image with the VAE.\n\nFormally, given an image, the VAE encodes it as a latent vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{0}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\). Define a forward \"noise injecting\" Markov chain \\(p(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}}|\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i-1}}):=\\mathcal{N}( \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}};\\sqrt{1-\\alpha_{t_{i}}}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{0}}, \\alpha_{t_{i}}\\boldsymbol{I})\\) where \\(\\{\\alpha_{t_{i}}\\}_{i=1}^{T}\\) is defined following a schedule so that \\(p(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{T}})\\) is approximately zero-mean isotropic. The corresponding denoising reverse chain is then parameterized as\n\n\\[p(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i-1}}|\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}}):=\\mathcal{N}( \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i-1}};\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\alpha_{t_{i}}}}(\\boldsymbol{ \\ell}_{t_{i}}+\\alpha_{t_{i}}\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}},t_{i})),\\,\\alpha_{t_{i}}\\boldsymbol{I}), \\tag{1}\\]\n\nfor some denoising network \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\ell},t)\\) with parameters \\(\\theta\\). Intuitively, the forward process iteratively adds noise to some signal at a fixed rate, while the reverse process, using a neural network, removes noise until recovering the signal. To train the network, given caption-image pairs, we optimize\n\n\\[\\min_{\\theta}\\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\zeta_{i}\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}}| \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{0}})}\\|\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}},t_{i} )-\\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}}}\\log p(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{i}}| \\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t_{0}})\\|_{2}^{2}, \\tag{2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\{\\zeta_{i}\\}_{t=1}^{T}\\) are constants computed as \\(\\zeta_{i}:=1-\\prod_{j=1}^{i}(1-\\alpha_{j})\\). The objective is a reweighted form of the evidence lower bound for score matching (Song et al., 2021). To generate a latent vector, we initialize \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\ell}}_{t_{T}}\\) as Gaussian noise and iterate\n\n\\[\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\ell}}_{t_{i-1}}=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\alpha_{t_{i}}}}(\\hat{ \\boldsymbol{\\ell}}_{t_{i}}+\\alpha_{t_{i}}\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{ \\ell}}_{t_{i}},t_{i}))+\\sqrt{\\alpha_{t_{i}}}z_{t_{i}}. \\tag{3}\\]\n\nIn practice, we apply various optimizations to improve the convergence of the above step, like modeling the reverse process as an ODE (Song et al., 2021), but this definition suffices for us. We can additionally condition the latent vectors on text and pass word embeddings \\(\\boldsymbol{X}:=[\\boldsymbol{x}_{1};\\cdots;\\boldsymbol{x}_{l_{W}}]\\) to \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\ell},t;\\boldsymbol{X})\\). Finally, the VAE decodes the denoised latent \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\ell}}_{t_{0}}\\) to an image. For this paper, we use the publicly available weights of the state-of-the-art, 1.1 billion-parameter Stable Diffusion 2.0 model (Rombach et al., 2022), trained on 5 billion caption-image pairs (Schuhmann et al., 2022) and implemented in HuggingFace's Diffusers library (von Platen et al., 2022).\n\n### Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps\n\nGiven a large-scale latent diffusion model for text-to-image synthesis, which parts of an image does each word influence most? One way to achieve this would be attribution approaches, which are mainly perturbation- and gradient-based (Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola, 2018; Selvaraju et al., 2017), where saliency maps are constructed either from the first derivative of the output with respect to the input, or from input perturbation to see how the output changes. Unfortunately, gradient methods prove intractable due to needing a backpropagation pass _for every pixel for all \\(T\\) time steps_, and even minor perturbations result in significantly different images in our pilot experiments.\n\nInstead, we use ideas from natural language processing, where word attention was found to indicate lexical attribution (Clark et al., 2019), as well as the spatial layout of Imagen's images (Hertz et al., 2022). In diffusion models, attention mechanisms cross-contextualize text embeddings with coordinate-aware latent representations (Rombach et al., 2022) of the image, outputting scores for each token-image patch pair. Attention scores lend themselves readily to interpretation since they are already normalized in \\([0,1]\\).Thus, for pixelwise attribution, we propose to aggregate these scores over the spatiotemporal dimensions and interpolate them across the image.\n\nWe turn our attention to the denoising network \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\ell},t;\\boldsymbol{X})\\) responsible for the synthesis. While the subnetwork can take any form, U-Nets remain the popular choice (Ronneberger et al., 2015) due to their strong image segmentation ability. They consist of a series of downsampling convolutional blocks, each of which preserves some local context, followed by upsampling deconvolutional blocks, which restore the original input size to the output. Specifically, given a 2D latent \\(\\boldsymbol{\\ell}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{w\\times h}\\), the downsampling blocks output a series of vectors \\(\\{\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{i,t}\\}_{i=1}^{K}\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{i,t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\lceil\\frac{w}{c!}\\rceil \\times\\lceil\\frac{h}{c!}\\rceil}\\) for some \\(c>1\\). The upsampling blocks then iteratively upscale \\(\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{K,t}\\) to \\(\\{\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\uparrow}_{i,t}\\}_{i=K-1}^{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\lceil\\frac{w}{ c!}\\rceil\\times\\lceil\\frac{h}{c!}\\rceil}\\). To condition these representations on word embeddings, Rombach et al. (2022) use multi-headed cross-attention layers (Vaswani et al., 2017)\n\n\\[\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{i,t}:=F^{(i)}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{h}^{ \\downarrow}_{i,t},\\boldsymbol{X})\\cdot(W^{(i)}_{v}\\boldsymbol{X}), \\tag{4}\\] \\[F^{(i)}_{t}(\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{i,t},\\boldsymbol{X}):= \\text{softmax}\\left((W^{(i)}_{\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{i,t}})(W^{(k)}_{k} \\boldsymbol{X})^{T}/\\sqrt{d}\\right), \\tag{5}\\]\n\nwhere \\(F^{(i)\\downarrow}_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\lceil\\frac{w}{c!}\\rceil\\times\\lceil\\frac {h}{c!}\\rceil\\times l_{H}\\times l_{W}}\\) and \\(W_{k}\\), \\(W_{q}\\), and \\(W_{v}\\) are projection matrices with \\(l_{H}\\) attention heads. The same mechanism applies when upsampling \\(\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\uparrow}_{i}\\). For brevity, we denote the respective attention score arrays as \\(F^{(i)\\downarrow}_{t}\\) and \\(F^{(i)\\uparrow}_{t}\\), and we implicitly broadcast matrix multiplications as per NumPy convention (Harris et al., 2020).\n\n**Spatiotemporal aggregation.**\\(F^{(i)\\downarrow}_{t}[x,y,\\ell,k]\\) is normalized to \\([0,1]\\) and connects the \\(k^{\\text{th}}\\) word to the intermediate coordinate \\((x,y)\\) for the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) downsampling block and \\(\\ell^{\\text{th}}\\) head. Due to the fully convolutional nature of U-Net (and the VAE), the intermediate coordinates locally map to a surrounding affected square area in the final image, the scores thus relating each word to that image patch. However, different layers produce heat maps with varying scales, deepest ones being the coarsest (e.g., \\(\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\downarrow}_{K,t}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{h}^{\\uparrow}_{K-1,t}\\)), requiring spatial normalization to create a single heat map. To do this, we upscale all intermediate attention score arrays to the original image size using bicubic interpolation, then sum them over the heads, layers, and time steps:\n\n\\[D^{\\mathbb{R}}_{k}[x,y]:=\\sum_{i,j,\\ell}\\bar{F}^{(i)\\downarrow}_{t,j,\\ell,t}[x,y]+\\bar{F}^{(i)\\uparrow}_{t_{j},k,\\ell}[x,y], \\tag{6}\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the \\(k^{\\text{th}}\\) word and \\(\\bar{F}^{(i)\\downarrow}_{t_{j},k,\\ell}[x,y]\\) is shorthand for \\(F^{(i)\\downarrow}_{t}[x,y,\\ell,k]\\), bicubically upscaled to fixed size \\((w,h)\\).1 Since \\(D^{\\mathbb{R}}_{k}\\) is positive and scale normalized (summing normalized values preserves linear scale), we can visualize it as a soft heat map, with higher values having greater attribution. To generate a hard, binary heat map (either a pixel is influenced or not), we can threshold \\(D^{\\mathbb{R}}_{k}\\) as\n\nFootnote 1: We show that aggregating across _all_ time steps and layers is indeed necessary in Section A.1.\n\n\\[D^{\\mathbb{I}_{v}}_{k}[x,y]:=\\mathbb{I}\\left(D^{\\mathbb{R}}_{k}[x,y]\\geq\\tau \\max_{i,j}D^{\\mathbb{R}}_{k}[i,j]\\right), \\tag{7}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)\\) is the indicator function and \\(\\tau\\in[0,1]\\). See Figure 2 for an illustration of DAAM.\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of computing DAAM for some word: the multiscale attention arrays from Eqn. (5) (see **A**); the bicubic interpolation (**B**) resulting in expanded maps (**C**); summing the heat maps across the layers (**D**), as in Eqn. (6); and the thresholding (**E**) from Eqn. (7).\n\n## 3 Attribution Analyses\n\n### Object Attribution\n\nQuantitative evaluation of our method is challenging, but we can attempt to draw upon existing annotated datasets and methods to see how well our method aligns. A popular visuosemantic task is image segmentation, where areas (i.e., segmentation masks) are given a semantically meaningful label, commonly nouns. If DAAM is accurate, then our attention maps should arguably align with the image segmentation labels for these tasks--despite not having been trained to perform this task.\n\n**Setup.** We ran Stable Diffusion 2.0-base using 30 inference steps per image with the DPM (Lu et al., 2022) solver--see Appendix A.1. We then synthesized one set of images using the validation set of the COCO image captions dataset (Lin et al., 2014), representing realistic prompts, and another set by randomly swapping nouns in the same set (holding the vocabulary fixed), representing unrealism. The purpose of the second set was to see how well the model generalized to uncanny prompts, whose composition was unlikely to have been encountered at training time. We named the two sets \"COCO-Gen\" and \"Unreal-Gen,\" each with 500 prompt-image pairs. For ground truth, we extracted all countable nouns from the prompts, then hand-segmented each present noun in the image.\n\nTo compute binary DAAM segmentation masks, we used Eqn. 7 with thresholds \\(\\tau\\in\\{0.3,0.4,0.5\\}\\), for each noun in the ground truth. We refer to these methods as DAAM-\\(\\langle\\tau\\rangle\\), e.g., DAAM-0.3. For supervised baselines, we evaluated semantic segmentation models trained explicitly on COCO, like Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) with a ResNet-101 backbone (He et al., 2016), QueryInst (Fang et al., 2021) with ResNet-101-FPN (Lin et al., 2017), and Mask2Former (Cheng et al., 2022) with Swin-S (Liu et al., 2021), all implemented in MMDetection (Chen et al., 2019), as well as the open-vocabulary CLIPSeg (Luddecke and Ecker, 2022) trained on the PhraseCut dataset (Wu et al., 2020). We note that CLIPSeg's setup resembles ours since the image captions are assumed given as well. However, theirs is supervised since they train their model on segmentation labels as well. Our unsupervised baselines consisted of the state-of-the-art STEGO (Hamilton et al., 2021) and PiCIE + H (Cho et al., 2021). As is standard (Lin et al., 2014), we evaluated all approaches using the mean intersection over union (mIoU) over the prediction-truth mask pairs. We denote mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\) when restricted to the 80 COCO classes that the supervised baselines were trained on and mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\) as the mIoU without the class restriction; see Sec. B for details.\n\n**Results.** We present results in Table 1. The COCO-supervised models (rows 1-3) are constrained to COCO's 80 classes (e.g., \"cat,\" \"cake\"), while DAAM (rows 5-7) is open vocabulary; thus, DAAM outperforms them by 22-28 points in mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\) and underperforms by 20 points in mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\). CLIPSeg (row 4), an open-vocabulary model trained on semantic segmentation datasets, achieves the best of both worlds in mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\) and mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\), with the highest mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\) overall and high mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\). However, its restriction to nouns precludes it from generalized segmentation (e.g., verbs). DAAM largely outperforms both unsupervised baselines (rows 6-7) by a margin of 6-27 points (except for STEGO on COCO-Gen mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\), where it's similar), likely because we assume the prompts to be provided. Similar findings hold on the unrealistic Unreal-Gen set, showing that DAAM is resilient to nonsensical texts, confirming that DAAM works when Stable Diffusion has to generalize in composition.\n\nAs for \\(\\tau\\), 0.4 works best on all splits, though it isn't too sensitive, varying by 0.1-5 points in mIoU. We also show that all layers and time steps contribute to DAAM's segmentation quality in Section A.1. Overall, DAAM forms a strong baseline of 58.1-64.8 mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\). As our goal is to prove sanity, not state of the art, we conclude that DAAM is sane for noun attribution, which we extend to all parts of speech in the next section.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{\\# Method} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{COCO-Gen} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Unreal-Gen} \\\\  & mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\) & mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\) & mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\) & mIoU\\({}^{\\text{80}}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{c}{Supervised Methods} \\\\ \\hline\n1 Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) & 80.4 & 26.9 & 84.0 & 25.7 \\\\\n2 QueryInst (ResNet-101-FPN) & 81.2 & 27.1 & 83.6 & 25.5 \\\\\n3 Mask2Former (Swin-S) & **82.0** & 27.4 & **85.0** & 25.9 \\\\\n4 CLIPSeg & 74.2 & **67.0** & 79.0 & **64.5** \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{c}{Unsupervised Methods} \\\\ \\hline\n5 Whole image mask & 21.7 & 20.6 & 24.8 & 24.0 \\\\\n6 PiCIE + H & 31.7 & 22.3 & 35.9 & 29.2 \\\\\n7 STEGO (DINO ViT-B) & 42.0 & **61.3** & 38.2 & 56.6 \\\\\n8 Our DAAM-0.3 & 62.7 & 57.0 & 64.7 & **62.6** \\\\\n9 Our DAAM-0.4 & **62.8** & 58.8 & **64.8** & 62.2 \\\\\n10 Our DAAM-0.5 & 59.6 & 55.9 & 60.0 & 57.1 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Mean IoU of semantic segmentation methods on our synthesized datasets. Best in each section bolded.\n\n### Generalized Attribution\n\nWe extend our veracity analyses beyond nouns to all parts of speech, such as adjectives and verbs, to show that DAAM is more generally applicable. A high-quality, reliable analysis requires human annotation; hence, we ask human raters to evaluate the attribution quality of DAAM maps, using a five-point Likert scale.\n\nThis setup generalizes that of the last section because words in general are not visually separable, which prevents effective segmentation annotation. For example, in the prompt \"people running,\" it is unclear where to visually segment \"running.\" Is it just the knees and feet of the runners, or is it also the swinging arms? On the contrary, if annotators are instead given the proposed heat maps for \"running,\" they can make a judgement on how well the maps reflect the word.\n\n**Setup.** To construct our word-image dataset, we first randomly sampled 200 words from each of the 14 most common part-of-speech tags in COCO, extracted with spaCy, for a total of 2,800 unique word-prompt pairs. Next, we generated images alongside DAAM maps for all pairs, varying the random seed each time. To gather human judgements, we built our annotation interface in Amazon MTurk, a crowdsourcing platform. We presented the generated image, the heat map, and the prompt with the target word in red, beside a question asking expert workers to rate how well the highlighting reflects the word. They then selected a rating among one of \"bad,\" \"poor,\" \"fair,\" \"good,\" and \"excellent\", as well as an option to declare the image itself as too poor or the word too abstract to interpret. For quality control, we removed annotators failing attention tests. For further robustness, we assigned three unique raters to each example. We provide further details on the user interface and annotation process in the appendix section A.2.\n\n**Results.** Our examples were judged by a total of fifty raters, none producing more than 18% of the total number of annotations. We filtered out all word-image pairs deemed too abstract (e.g., \"the\"), when any one of the three assigned raters selected that option. This resulted in six interpretable part-of-speech tags with enough judgements; see the appendix for detailed statistics. To compute the final score of each word-image pair, we took the median of the three raters' opinions.\n\nWe plot our results in Figure 3. In the top subplot, we show that DAAM maps for adjectives, verbs, nouns, and proper nouns attain close to or slightly above \"good,\" whereas the ones for numerals and adverbs are closer to \"fair.\" This agrees with the generated examples in Figure 4, where numerals (see the giraffes' edges) and adverbs (feet and ground motion blur) are less intuitively highlighted than adjectives (blue part of teapot), verbs (fists and legs in running form), and nouns. Nevertheless, the proportion of ratings falling between fair and excellent are above 80% for numerals and adverbs and 90% for the rest--see the bottom of Figure 3. We thus conclude that DAAM produces plausible maps for each interpretable part of speech.\n\nOne anticipated criticism is that different heat maps may explain the same word, making a qualitative comparison less meaningful. In Figure 4, \"quickly\" could conceivably explain \"running\" too. We concede to this, but our motivation is not to compare _quality_ but rather to demonstrate _plausibility_. Without these experiments, the DAAM maps for words like \"running\" and \"blue\" could very well have been meaningless blotches.\n\nFigure 4: Example generations and DAAM heat maps from COCO for each interpretable part-of-speech.\n\nFigure 3: On the top, mean opinion scores grouped by part of speech, with 95% confidence interval bars; on the bottom, proportion of fair\u2013excellent scores, grouped by part-of-speech.\n\n## 4 Visuosyntactic Analysis\n\nEquipped with DAAM, we now study how syntax relates to generated pixels. We characterize pairwise interactions between head-dependent DAAM maps, augmenting previous sections and helping to form hypotheses for further research.\n\n**Setup.** We randomly sampled 1,000 prompts from COCO, performed dependency parsing with CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), and generated an image for each prompt and DAAM maps for all words. We constrained ourselves to the top-10 most common relations, resulting in 8,000 head-dependent pairs. Following Section 3.1, we then binarized the maps to quantify map pair interactions with set-based similarity statistics. We computed three statistics between the DAAM map of the head and that of the dependent: first, the mIoU, i.e., \\(\\frac{|A\\cap B|}{|A\\cap B|}\\); second, the intersection over the dependent (mIoD; \\(\\frac{|A\\cap B|}{|A|}\\)); and third, the intersection over the head (mIoH; \\(\\frac{|A\\cap B|}{|A|}\\)). mIoU measures similarity, and the difference between mIoD and mIoH quantifies dominance. If mIoD \\(>\\) mIoH, then the head contains (dominates) the dependent more, and vice versa--see Appendix B for a visual tutorial.\n\n**Results.** We present our results in Table 2 and Figure 5. We computed baseline overlap statistics for unrelated word pairs and all head-dependent pairs. Unsurprisingly, both baselines show moderate similarity and no dominance (43-48 mIoU, \\(\\Delta\\leq 1\\); rows 1-2). For syntactic relations, we observe no dominance for noun compounds (row 3), which is expected since the two nouns complement one another (e.g., \"ice cream\"). Punctuation and articles (punct, det; rows 4 and 6) also lack dominance, possibly from having little semantic meaning and attending broadly across the image (Figure 5, top right). This resembles findings in Kovaleva et al. (2019), who note BERT's Devlin et al. (2019) punctuation to attend widely. For nouns joined with \"and\" (row 5), the maps overlap less (38.7 mIoU vs. 50+), likely due to visual separation (e.g., \"_cat_ and _dog_\"). However, the overlap is still far above zero, which we attribute partially to feature entanglement, further explored in Section 5.1.\n\nStarting at row 8, we arrive at pairs where one map dominates the other. A group in core arguments arises (nsubj, obj), where the head word dominates the noun subject's or object's map (12-29-point \\(\\Delta\\)), perhaps since verbs contextualize both the subject and the object in its surroundings--see the middle of and bottom left of Fig. 5. We observe another group in nominal dependents (nmod:of, amod, acl), where nmod:of mostly points to collective nouns (e.g., \"_pile_ of _oranges_\"), whose dominance is intuitive. In contrast, adjectival modifiers (amod) behave counterintuitively, where descriptive adjectives (dependents) visually dominate the nouns they modify (\\(\\Delta\\approx 15\\)). We instead expect objects to contain their attributes, but this is not the case. We again ascribe this to entanglement, elucidated in Section 5.2. Lastly, coreferent word pairs exhibit the highest overlap out of all relations (66.6 mIoU), indicating coreference resolution.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l c c c|c} \\hline \\hline \\# & Relation & mIoD & mIoH & \\(\\Delta\\) & mIoU \\\\ \\hline\n1 & Unrelated pairs & 65.1 & 66.1 & 1.0 & 47.5 \\\\\n2 & All head\u2013dependent pairs & 62.3 & 62.0 & 0.3 & 43.4 \\\\ \\hline\n3 & compound & 71.3 & 71.5 & 0.2 & 51.1 \\\\\n4 & punct & 68.2 & 70.0 & 1.8 & 49.5 \\\\\n5 & nconj:and & 58.0 & 56.1 & 1.9 & 38.2 \\\\\n6 & det & 54.8 & 52.2 & 2.6 & 35.0 \\\\\n7 & case & 51.7 & 58.1 & 6.4 & 36.9 \\\\\n8 & acl & **67.4** & 79.3 & 12.5 & 55.4 \\\\\n9 & nsubj & 76.4 & **63.9** & 12. & 52.2 \\\\\n10 & amod & **62.4** & 77.6 & 15. & 51.1 \\\\\n11 & mmod:of & 73.5 & **57.9** & 16. & 47.5 \\\\\n12 & obj & 75.6 & **46.3** & 29. & 55.4 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Head\u2013dependent DAAM map overlap statistics across the ten most common relations in COCO.

Note that the visualization scale is normalized for each image since our purpose is to study the _spatial locality_ of attribution _conditioned on the word_. For example, the absolute magnitude for the comma above is weak.\n\n## 5 Visuosemantic Analyses\n\n### Cohyponym Entanglement\n\nTo further study the large nconj: and overlap found in Section 4, we hypothesize that semantically similar words in a prompt have worse generation quality, where only one of the words is generated in the image, not all.\n\n**Setup.** To test our hypothesis, we used WordNet [19] to construct a hierarchical ontology expressing semantic fields over COCO's 80 visual objects, of which 28 have at least one other cohyponym across 16 distinct hypernyms (as listed in the appendix). Next, we used the prompt template, \"a(n) <=oum> and a(n) <=oum>,\" depicting two distinct things, to generate our dataset. Using our ontology, we randomly sampled two cohyponyms 50% of the time and two non-cohyponyms other times, producing 1,000 prompts from the template (e.g., \"a _giraffe_ and a _zebra_,\" \"a _cake_ and a _bus_\"). We generated an image for each prompt, then asked three unique annotators per image to select which objects were present, given the 28 words. We manually verified the image-label pairs, rejecting and republishing incorrect ones. Finally, we marked the overall label for each image as the top two most commonly picked nouns, ties broken by submission order. We considered generations correct if both words in the prompt were present in the image. For more setup details, see the appendix.\n\n**Results.** Overall, the non-cohyponym set attains a generation accuracy of 61% and the cohyponym set 52%, statistically significant at the 99% level according to the exact test, supporting our hypothesis. To see if DAAM assists in explaining these effects, we compute binarized DAAM maps (\\(\\tau=0.4\\), the best value from Sec. 3.1) for both words and quantify the amount of overlap with IoU. We find that the mIoU for cohyponyms and non-cohyponyms are 46.7 and 22.9, suggesting entangled attention and composition. In the top of Figure 6, we further group the mIoU by cohyponym status and correctness, finding that incorrectness and cohyponymy independently increase the overlap. In the bottom subplot, we show that the amount of overlap (mIoU) differentiates correctness, with the low, mid, and high cutoff points set at \\(\\leq\\) 0.4, 0.4-0.6, and \\(\\geq\\) 0.6, following statistics in Section 4. We observe accuracy to be much better on pairs with low overlap (71.7-77.5%) than those with high overlap (9.8-36%). We present some example generations and maps in Figure 7, which supports our results.\n\n### Adjectival Entanglement\n\nWe examine prompts where a noun's modifying adjective attends too broadly across the image. We start with an initial seed prompt of the form, \"a <adj> <noun> <verb phrase>,\" then vary the adjective to see how the image changes. If there is no entanglement, then the background _should_\n\nFigure 8: First row: a DAAM map for \u201crusty\u201d and three generated images for \u201ca <adj> shovel sitting in a clean shed;\u201d second row: a map for \u201cbumpy\u201d and images for \u201ca <adj> ball rolling down a hill.\u201d\n\nFigure 6: Above: DAAM map overlap in mean IoU, subdivided by cohyponym status and correctness; below: generation accuracy, subdivided by cohyponym status and amount of overlap.\n\nFigure 7: Rows starting from the top: generated images for cohyponyms \u201ca giraffe and a zebra,\u201d heat maps for the first two images, and heat maps for non-cohyponymic zebra\u2013fridge and giraffe\u2013fridge prompts.\n\n_not_ gain attributes pertaining to that adjective. To remove scene layout as a confounder, we fix all cross-attention maps to those of the seed prompt, which Hertz et al. (2022) show to equalize layout.\n\nOur first case is, \"a {rusty, metallic, wooden} shovel sitting in a clean shed,\" \"rusty\" being the seed adjective. As shown in Figure 8, the DAAM map for \"rusty\" attends broadly, and the background for \"rusty\" is surely not clean. When we change the adjective to \"metallic\" and \"wooden,\" the shed changes along with it, becoming grey and wooden, indicating entanglement. Similar observations apply to our second case, \"a {bumpy, smooth, spiky} ball rolling down a hill,\" where \"bumpy\" produces rugged ground, \"smooth\" flatter ground, and \"spiky\" blades of grass. In our third case, we study color adjectives using \"a {blue, green, red} car driving down the streets,\" presented in Figure 9. We discover the same phenomena, with the difference that these prompts lead to _quantifiable_ notions of adjectival entanglement. For, say, \"green,\" we can conceivably measure the amount of additional green hue in the background, with the car cropped out--see bottom row. A caveat is that entanglement is not necessarily unwanted; for instance, rusty shovels likely belong in rusted areas. It strongly depends on the use case of the model.\n\n## 6 Related Work and Future Directions\n\nThe primary area of this work is in understanding neural networks from the perspective of computational linguistics, with the goal of better informing future research. A large body of relevant papers exists, where researchers apply textual perturbation Wallace et al. (2019), attention visualization Vig (2019); Kovaleva et al. (2019); Shimaoka et al. (2016), and information bottlenecks Jiang et al. (2020) to relate important input tokens to the outputs of large language models. Others explicitly test for linguistic constructs within models, such as probing vision transformers for verb understanding Hendricks and Nematzadeh (2021) and examining visual grounding in image-to-text transformers Ilinykh and Dobnik (2022). Our distinction is that we carry out an attributive analysis in the space of generative diffusion models, as the pixel output relates to syntax and semantics. As a future extension, we plan to assess the unsupervised parsing ability of Stable Diffusion with syntactic-geometric probes, similar to Hewitt and Manning's (2019) work in BERT.\n\nThe intersection of text-to-image generation and natural language processing is substantial. In the context of enhancing diffusion models with prompt engineering, Hertz et al. (2022) apply cross-attention maps for the purpose of precision-editing generated images using text, and Woolf (2022) proposes negative prompts for removing undesirable, scene-wide attributes. Related as well are works for generative adversarial networks, where Karras et al. (2019) and Materzynska et al. (2022) disentangle various features such as style and spelling. Along this vein, our work exposes more entanglement in cohyponyms and adjectives. A future line of work is how to disentangle such concepts and improve generative quality.\n\nLast but not least are semantic segmentation works in computer vision. Generally, researchers start with a backbone encoder, attach decoders, and then optimize the model in its entirety end-to-end on a segmentation dataset Cheng et al. (2022), unless the context is unsupervised, in which case one uses contrastive objectives and clustering Cho et al. (2021); Hamilton et al. (2021). Toward this, DAAM could potentially provide encoder features in a segmentation pipeline, where its strong raw baseline numbers suggest the presence of valuable latent representations in Stable Diffusion.\n\n## 7 Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we study visuolinguistic phenomena in diffusion models by interpreting word-pixel cross-attention maps. We prove the correctness of our attribution method, DAAM, through a quantitative semantic segmentation task and a qualitative generalized attribution study. We apply DAAM to assess how syntactic relations translate to visual interactions, finding that certain maps of heads appropriately subsume their dependents'. We use these findings to form hypotheses about feature entanglement, showing that cohyponyms are jumbled and adjectives attend too broadly.\n\nFigure 9: A DAAM map and generated images for \u201ca \u2018<adj> car driving down the streets,\u201d above images of the cropped background, oversaturated for visualization.\n\n### Limitations\n\nOur analysis has both methodological and technical limitations. While dependency parsers are the most robust semanto-syntactic tools available to us, we are limited both by the quality of the parser's output and its paradigm. All automated tools make errors, and while our work uses short and simple phrases that are comparatively easy for these tools to handle, it is possible that even systematic errors could keep into the analysis. It is also possible that other semanto-syntactic tools would highlight different phenomena and improve (or worsen) the quality of the analysis.\n\nDue to the dataset used, which we picked for quantitative comparison to prior art, there is an inherent bias towards _concrete_ concepts, as they are derived from image captions. We are therefore limited in the understanding of how our method applies to more abstract concepts (say, \"love\" and \"dignity\"), potentially warranting further study.\n\nThere are also concerns about the internal validity of attention maps as an interpretability tool. For example, Serrano and Smith (2019) argue, \"[In many cases,] gradient-based rankings of attention weights better predict [models'] effects than their magnitudes.\" However, for the analysis of diffusion models, gradient methods are intractable because a backpropagation pass is required for every pixel for all time steps, as stated in Section 2.2. Therefore, attention scores remain the most feasible method.\n\nLastly, we have consciously limited ourselves to purely making analytical observations regarding attribution and entanglement. This has arguably allowed us to cover a very wide range of phenomena and make a large number of observations, but this choice naturally limits us to not providing a method to resolve the issues we have observed with existing models, which is something we have left (and described in Section 6) as future work.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nResources used in preparing this research were provided, in part, by the Province of Ontario, the Government of Canada through CIFAR, companies sponsoring the Vector Institute, and the HuggingFace team.

Diffusion models: A comprehensive survey of methods and applications. _arXiv:2209.00796_.\n\n## Appendix A Supplements for Attribution Analyses\n\n### Object Attribution\n\n**Generation setup.** For all images, we ran the Stable Diffusion 2.0 base model (512 by 512 pixels) with 30 inference steps, the default 7.5 classifier guidance score, and the state-of-the-art DPM solver. We automatically filtered out all offensive images, against which the 2.0 model has both training-time and after-inference protection. We also steered clear of offensive prompts, which were absent to start with in COCO. Our computational environment consisted of PyTorch 1.11.0 and CUDA 11.4, running on Titan RTX and A6000 graphics cards. Our spaCy model was en_core_web_md.\n\n**Segmentation process.** To draw the ground-truth segmentation masks, we used the object selection tool, the quick selection tool, and the brush from Adobe Photoshop CC 2022 to fill in a black mask for each area corresponding to a present noun. We then exported each mask (without the background image) as a binary PNG mask and attached it to the relevant noun--see Figure 10 for some examples. Two trained annotators worked on the total set of 1000 image-prompt pairs, with one completing 180 on each dataset and the other 320 on each.\n\n**Layer and time step ablation.** We conducted ablation studies to see if summing across _all_ time steps and layers, as in Eqn. 6, is necessary. We searched both sides of the summation: for one study, we restricted DAAM to \\(j\\leq j^{*}\\), as \\(j^{*}=1\\to T\\); for its dual study, we constrained \\(j\\geq j^{*}\\). We applied the same methods to layer resolution, i.e., \\(c^{i}\\). We present our results in Fig. 11, which suggests that all time steps and layers contribute positively to segmentation quality.\n\n**Dice score and pixel accuracy.** We also ran COCO-Gen experiments with pixel accuracy and dice score metrics, two less common ones in the segmentation literature. In terms of pixel accuracy, CLIPSeg attained 90%, DAAM-0.4 90%, and Mask2former 85%, which largely agrees with our mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\) findings. We conjecture that DAAM and Mask2former improve against CLIPSeg because pixel accuracy penalizes outliers less. For dice score, CLIPSeg achieved 72, DAAM-0.4 68, and Mask2former 30, which also agrees with our mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\) results. We conclude that, in addition to mIoU, both metrics support the use of DAAM.\n\n### Generalized Attribution\n\n**Annotation process.** We designed our annotation UIs for Amazon MTurk, a popular crowdsourcing platform, where we submitted jobs requiring three unique annotators at the master level to complete each task. We presented the UI pictured in Figure 12, asking them to rate the relevance of the red word to the highlighted area in the image. If the image was too poor or if the word was missing, they could also choose options 6 and 7.\n\nTo filter out low-quality or inattentive annotators, we randomly asked workers to interpret punctuation, such as periods. Since these tokens are self-evidently too abstract and missing in the image, we removed workers who didn't select one of those two options. However, we found overall attention to be high, having a reject rate of less than 2% of the tasks, consistent with Hauser and Schwarz's (2016) findings that MTurk users outperform subject pool participants. We show response statistics in Figure 13, where adpositions, coordinating conjunctions, participles, punctuation, and articles have high non-interpretable rates.\n\nFigure 11: On the left, taking the first \\(n\\) or last \\(n\\) time steps; on the right, the equivalent for layer resolution.\n\nFigure 10: Example ground-truth segmentation masks from four prompt\u2013image pairs.\n\n**Preliminary CLIPSeg comparison.** We briefly conducted additional experiments within Section 3.2 using CLIPSeg to compare its attribution ability to DAAM. We find that DAAM significantly (p < 0.02; unpaired \\(t\\)-test) outperforms CLIPSeg on verbs, proper nouns, and adverbs, because CLIPSeg was unable to produce viable maps. No significant differences were noted on nouns and adjectives, which CLIPSeg can segment. Overall, DAAM outperforms CLIPSeg by 0.9 MOS points (3.4 vs 2.5). We conclude that, while CLIPSeg is plausible for some parts-of-speech, such as nouns, it is implausible for others.\n\n## Appendix B Supplements for Syntactic Analyses\n\n**Measures of overlap.** We use three measures of overlap to characterize head-dependent map interactions: mean intersection over union (mIoU), intersection over the dependent (mIoD), and intersection over the head (mIoH). When mIoU is high, the maps overlap greatly; when mIoD is high but mIoH is low, the head map occupies more of the dependent than the dependent does the head; when the opposite is true, the dependent occupies more.\n\nConcretely, given a sequence of binarized DAAM map pairs \\(\\{(D_{(i1)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{\\tau}},D_{(i2)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{\\tau}})\\}_{i=1}^{n}\\), where \\(i1\\) are **dependent** indices and \\(i2\\)**head** indices, we compute mIoU as\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\sum_{(x,y)}D_{(i1)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{\\tau}}[x,y] \\wedge D_{(i2)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{\\tau}}[x,y]}{\\sum_{(x,y)}D_{(i1)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{ \\tau}}[x,y]\\lor D_{(i2)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{\\tau}}[x,y]}, \\tag{8}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\wedge\\) is the logical-and operator, returning 1 if both sides are 1, 0 otherwise, and \\(\\vee\\) the logical- or operator, returning 1 if at least one operand is 1, and 0 otherwise. Let the top part of the inner fraction be the intersection, or Int for short. Define mIoD as\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\text{Int}}{\\sum_{(x,y)}D_{(i1)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{ \\tau}}[x,y]}, \\tag{9}\\]\n\nand mIoH as\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\text{Int}}{\\sum_{(x,y)}D_{(i2)}^{\\mathbb{I}_{ \\tau}}[x,y]}, \\tag{10}\\]\n\nWe visually present our mIoD and mIoH statistics in Figure 14.\n\nTo compute mIoU\\({}^{\\infty}\\), we compute mIoU (Eqn. 8) without restricting ourselves to the typical 80 COCO classes. For mIoU[80], we only look at objects with one of those labels.\n\nFigure 14: Portrays of mIoD, mIoH, and different forms of overlap. Note that pixel accuracy, a common metric, is in fact the same as mIoD or mIoH, depending on if we regard either the dependent or the head map as the ground truth.\n\nFigure 12: Annotation UI for generalized attribution.\n\nFigure 13: Response statistics by part of speech.\n\n## Appendix C Supplements for Semantic Analyses\n\n**Semantic relation ontology.** We present our relation ontology below, continued on the next page:\n\n**Cohyponym annotation process.** Similar to the generalized attribution annotation process, we designed our UIs for Amazon MTurk. We submitted a job requiring three unique annotators at the master level to complete each task. We presented to them the UI shown in Figure 15. We manually verified each response, removing workers whose quality was consistently poor. This included workers who didn't include all objects generated. Overall, the worker quality was exceptional, with a reject rate below 2%. Out of a pool of 30 workers, no single worker annotated more than 16% of the examples.\n\nFigure 15: The annotation UI for cohyponym entanglement, asking annotators to pick the present objects.\n\n**ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist**\n\nA For every submission:\n\nA1.

A significant portion of this data includes facts and opinions which, on one hand, celebrate democracy and diversity of ideas, and on the other hand are inherently socially biased. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure media biases in LMs trained on such corpora, along social and economic axes, and (2) measure the fairness of downstream NLP models trained on top of politically biased LMs. We focus on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of political (social, economic) biases in pretraining data on the fairness of high-stakes social-oriented tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have political leanings which reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating social biases into hate speech predictions and media biases into misinformation detectors. We discuss the implications of our findings for NLP research and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.\n\nFootnote 1: Code and data are publicly available at [https://github.com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean](https://github.com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean).\n\n1\nFootnote 2: Code and data are publicly available at [https://github.com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean](https://github.com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean).\n\n1\nFootnote 2: Code and data are publicly available at [https://github.com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean](https://github.com/BunsenFeng/PoliLean).\n\n_Warning: This paper contains examples of hate speech._\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nDigital and social media have become a major source of political news dissemination (Hermida et al., 2012; Kumpel et al., 2015; Hermida, 2016) with unprecedentedly high user engagement rates (Mustafaraj and Metaxas, 2011; Velasquez, 2012; Garimella et al., 2018). The volume of online discourse surrounding polarizing issues--climate change, gun control, abortion, wage gaps, death penalty, taxes, same-sex marriage, and more--has been drastically growing in the past decade (Valenzuela et al., 2012; Rainie et al., 2012; Enikolopov et al., 2019). While online political engagement promotes democratic values and diversity of perspectives, these discussions also reflect and reinforce societal biases--stereotypical generalizations about people or social groups (Devine, 1989; Bargh, 1999; Blair, 2002). Such language constitutes a major portion of large language models' (LMs) pretraining data, propagating biases into downstream models.\n\nHundreds of studies have highlighted ethical issues in NLP models (Blodgett et al., 2020; Field et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022) and designed synthetic datasets (Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021) or controlled experiments to measure how biases in language are encoded in learned representations (Sun et al., 2019), and how annotator errors in training data are liable to increase unfairness of NLP models (Sap et al., 2019). However, the language of polarizing political issues is particularly complex (Demszky et al., 2019), and social biases hidden in language can rarely be reduced to pre-specified stereotypical associations (Joseph and Morgan, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has shown how to analyze the effects of naturally occurring media biases in pretraining data on language models, and subsequently on downstream tasks, and how it affects the fairness towards diverse social groups. Our study aims to fill this gap.\n\nAs a case study, we focus on the effects of media biases in pretraining data on the fairness of _hate speech detection_ with respect to diverse social attributes, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, and of _misinformation detection_ with respect to partisan leanings. We investigate how media biases in the pretraining data propagate into LMs and ultimately affect downstream tasks, because discussions about polarizing social and economic issues are abundant in pretraining data sourced from news, forums, books, and online encyclopedias, and this language inevitably perpetuates social stereotypes. We choose hate speechand misinformation classification because these are social-oriented tasks in which unfair predictions can be especially harmful (Duggan, 2017; League, 2019, 2021).\n\nTo this end, grounded in political spectrum theories (Eysenck, 1957; Rokeach, 1973; Gindler, 2021) and the political compass test,2 we propose to empirically quantify the political leaning of pretrained LMs (SS2). We then further pretrain language models on different partisan corpora to investigate whether LMs pick up political biases from training data. Finally, we train classifiers on top of LMs with varying political leanings and evaluate their performance on hate speech instances targeting different identity groups (Yoder et al., 2022), and on misinformation detection with different agendas (Wang, 2017). In this way, we investigate the propagation of political bias through the entire pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks.\n\nFootnote 2: [https://www.politicalcompass.org/test](https://www.politicalcompass.org/test)\n\nOur experiments across several data domains, partisan news datasets, and LM architectures (SS3) demonstrate that different pretrained LMs _do_ have different underlying political leanings, reinforcing the political polarization present in pretraining corpora (SS4.1). Further, while the overall performance of hate speech and misinformation detectors remains consistent across such politically-biased LMs, these models exhibit significantly different behaviors against different identity groups and partisan media sources. (SS4.2).\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are novel methods to quantify political biases in LMs, and findings that shed new light on how ideological polarization in pretraining corpora propagates biases into language models, and subsequently into social-oriented downstream tasks. In SS5, we discuss implications of our findings for NLP research, that _no language model can be entirely free from social biases_, and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.\n\n## 2 Methodology\n\nWe propose a two-step methodology to establish the effect of political biases in pretraining corpora on the fairness of downstream tasks: (1) we develop a framework, grounded in political science literature, to measure the inherent political leanings of pretrained language models, and (2) then investigate how the political leanings of LMs affect their performance in downstream social-oriented tasks.\n\n### Measuring the Political Leanings of LMs\n\nWhile prior works provided analyses of political leanings in LMs (Jiang et al., 2022; Argyle et al., 2022), they primarily focused on political individuals, rather than the timeless ideological issues grounded in political science literature. In contrast, our method is grounded in political spectrum theories (Eysenck, 1957; Rokeach, 1973; Gindler, 2021) that provide more nuanced perspective than the commonly used left vs. right distinction (Bobbio, 1996; Mair, 2007; Corballis and Beale, 2020) by assessing political positions on two axes: _social values_ (ranging from liberal to conservative) and _economic values_ (ranging from left to right).\n\nThe widely adopted **political compass test**,2 which is based on these theories, measures individuals' leaning on a two-dimensional space by analyzing their responses to 62 political statements.3 Participants indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement, and their responses are used to calculate their social and economic scores through weighted summation. Formally, the political compass test maps a set of answers indicating agreement level {strong disagree, disagree, agree, strong agree}62 to two-dimensional point \\((s_{soc},s_{eco})\\), where the social score \\(s_{soc}\\) and economic score \\(s_{eco}\\) range from \\([-10,10]\\). We employ this test as a tool to measure the political leanings of pretrained language models.\n\nFootnote 2: The 62 political statements are presented in Table 13. We also evaluated on other political ideology questionnaires, such as the 8 values test, and the findings are similar.\n\nWe probe a diverse set of LMs to measure their alignment with specific political statements, including encoder and language generation models (decoder and autoregressive). For encoder-only LMs, we use mask filling with prompts derived from the political statements. We construct the following prompt: _\"Please respond to the following statement:_ [statement] _I <MASK> with this statement.\"_ Then, pretrained LMs fill the mask and return 10 highest probability tokens. By comparing the aggregated probability of pre-defined positive (_agree, support, endorse_, etc.) and negative lexicons (_disagree, refute, oppose_, etc.) assigned by LMs, we map their answers to {strong disagree, disagree, strong agree}. Specifically, if the aggregated probability of positive lexicon scores is larger than the negative aggregate by 0.3,4 we deem the response as strong agree, and define strong disagree analogously.\n\nFootnote 4: The threshold was set empirically. Complete lists of positive and negative lexicons as well as the specific hyperparameters used for response mapping are listed in Appendix A.1.\n\nWe probe language generation models by conducting text generation based on the following prompt: _\"Please respond to the following statement:_ [statement]\\(\\backslash\\)_n Your response:\"_. We then use an off-the-shelf stance detector Lewis et al. (2019) to determine whether the generated response agrees or disagrees with the given statement. We use 10 random seeds for prompted generation, filter low-confidence responses using the stance detector, and average the stance detection scores for a more reliable evaluation.5\n\nFootnote 5: We established empirically that using multiple prompts results in more stable and consistent responses.\n\nUsing this framework, we aim to systematically evaluate the effect of polarization in pretraining data on the political bias of LMs. We thus train multiple partisan LMs through continued pretraining of existing LMs on data from various political viewpoints, and then evaluate how model's ideological coordinates shift. In these experiments, we only use established media sources, because our ultimate goal is to understand whether \"clean\" pretraining data (not overtly hateful or toxic) leads to undesirable biases in downstream tasks.\n\n### Measuring the Effect of LM's Political Bias on Downstream Task Performance\n\nArmed with the LM political leaning evaluation framework, we investigate the impact of these biases on downstream tasks with social implications such as hate speech detection and misinformation identification. We fine-tune different partisan versions of the same LM architecture on these tasks and datasets and analyze the results from two perspectives. This is a controlled experiment setting, only the partisan pretraining corpora is different, while the starting LM checkpoint, task-specific fine-tuning data, and all hyperparameters are the same. First, we look at overall performance differences across LMs with different leanings. Second, we examine per-category performance, breaking down the datasets into different socially informed groups (identity groups for hate speech and media sources for misinformation), to determine if the inherent political bias in LMs could lead to unfairness in downstream applications.\n\n## 3 Experiment Settings\n\nLM and Stance Detection ModelWe evaluate political biases of 14 language models: BERT Devlin et al. (2019), RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019), distilBERT Sanh et al. (2019), distilRoBERTa, ALBERT Lan et al. (2019), BART Lewis et al. (2020), GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019), GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020), GPT-J Wang and Komatsuzaki (2021), LLaMA Touvron et al. (2023), Alpaca Taori et al. (2023), Codex Chen et al. (2021), ChatGPT, GPT-4 OpenAI (2023) and their variants, representing a diverse range of model sizes and architectures. The specific versions and checkpoint names of each model are provided in Appendix C. For the stance detection model used for evaluating decoder-based language model responses, we use a BART-based model Lewis et al. (2019) trained on MultiNLI Williams et al. (2018).\n\nTo ensure the reliability of the off-the-shelf stance detector, we conduct a human evaluation on 110 randomly sampled responses and compare the results to those generated by the detector. The stance detector has an accuracy of 0.97 for LM responses with clear stances and high inter-annotator agreement among 3 annotators (0.85 Fleiss' Kappa). Details on the stance detector, the response-to-agreement mapping process, and the human evaluation are in Appendix A.2.\n\nPartisan Corpora for PretrainingWe collected partisan corpora for LM pretraining that focus on two dimensions: domain (news and social media) and political leaning (left, center, right). We used the POLITICS dataset Liu et al. (2022) for news articles, divided into left-leaning, right-leaning, and\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Dataset** & **\\# Datapoint** & **\\# Class** & **Class Distribution** & **Train/Dev/Test Split** & **Proposed In** \\\\ \\hline hate-identity & 159,872 & 2 & 47,968 / 111,904 & 76,736 / 19,184 / 63,952 & Yoder et al.

We also include subreddits that are not about politics as the center corpus for social media. Additionally, to address ethical concerns of creating hateful LMs, we used a hate speech classifier based on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and fine-tuned on the TweetEval benchmark (Barbieri et al., 2020) to remove potentially hateful content from the pretraining data. As a result, we obtained six pretraining corpora of comparable sizes: {left, center, right} x {reddit, news}. 7 These partisan pretraining corpora are approximately the same size. We further pretrain RoBERTa and GPT-2 on these corpora to evaluate their changes in ideological coordinates and to examine the relationship between the political bias in the pretraining data and the model's political leaning.\n\nFootnote 6: [https://www.allsides.com](https://www.allsides.com)\n\nFootnote 7: Details about pretraining corpora are in Appendix C.\n\nDownstream Task DatasetsWe investigate the connection between models' political biases and their downstream task behavior on two tasks: hate speech and misinformation detection. For hate speech detection, we adopt the dataset presented in Yoder et al. (2022) which includes examples divided into the identity groups that were targeted. We leverage the two official dataset splits in this work: Hate-Identity and Hate-Demographic. For misinformation detection, the standard PolitiFact dataset (Wang, 2017) is adopted, which includes the source of news articles. We evaluate RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and four variations of RoBERTa further pretrained on reddit-left, reddit-right, news-left, and news-right corpora. While other tasks and datasets (Emelin et al., 2021; Mathew et al., 2021) are also possible choices, we leave them for future work. We calculate the overall performance as well as the performance per category of different LM checkpoints. Statistics of the adopted downstream task datasets are presented in Table 1.\n\n## 4 Results and Analysis\n\nIn this section, we first evaluate the inherent political leanings of language models and their connection to political polarization in pretraining corpora. We then evaluate pretrained language models with different political leanings on hate speech and misinformation detection, aiming to understand the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \\hline \\hline\n**Statement** & **GPT-2** & **GPT-3 Ada** & **GPT-3 Daviol** \\\\ \\hline A significant advantage of a one-party state is that it avoids all the arguments that delay prices in a democratic political system. & Tann a strong believe that democratines is the process of government studies that politicians from delighting their to an elected leader.

Specifically, each original LM is mapped to a social score and an economic score with our proposed framework in Section 2.1. From the results, we find that:\n\n* Language models _do_ exhibit different ideological leanings, occupying all four quadrants on the political compass.\n* Generally, BERT variants of LMs are more socially conservative (authoritarian) compared to GPT model variants. This collective difference may be attributed to the composition of pretraining corpora: while the BookCorpus Zhu et al. (2015) played a significant role in early LM pretraining, Web texts such as CommonCrawl8 and WebText Radford et al. (2019) have become dominant pretraining corpora in more recent models. Since modern Web texts tend to be more liberal (libertarian) than older book texts Bell (2014), it is possible that LMs absorbed this liberal shift in pretraining data. Such differences could also be in part attributed to the reinforcement learning with human feedback data adopted in GPT-3 models and beyond. We additionally observe that different sizes of the same model family (e.g. ALBERT and BART) could have non-negligible differences in political leanings. We hypothesize that the change is due to a better generalization in large LMs, including overfitting biases in more subtle contexts, resulting in a shift of political leaning. We leave further investigation to future work. Footnote 8: [https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/](https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/)\n* Pretrained LMs exhibit stronger bias towards social issues (\\(y\\) axis) compared to economic ones (\\(x\\) axis). The average magnitude for social and economic issues is \\(2.97\\) and \\(0.87\\), respectively, with standard deviations of \\(1.29\\) and \\(0.84\\). This suggests that pretrained LMs show greater disagreement in their values concerning social issues. A possible reason is that the volume of social issue discussions on social media is higher than economic issues Flores-Saviaga et al. (2022); Raymond et al. (2022), since the bar for discussing economic issues is higher Crawford et al. (2017); Johnston and Wronski (2015), requiring background knowledge and a deeper understanding of economics.\n\nFigure 3: Pretraining LMs with the six partisan corpora and re-evaluate their position on the political spectrum.\n\nFigure 2: Change in RoBERTa political leaning from pretraining on pre-Trump corpora (start of the arrow) to post-Trump corpora (end of the arrow). Notably, the majority of setups move towards increased polarization (further away from the center) after pretraining on post-Trump corpora. Thus illustrates that pretrained language models _could_ pick up the heightened polarization in news and social media due to socio-political events.\n\nWe conducted a qualitative analysis to compare the responses of different LMs. Table 2 presents the responses of three pretrained LMs to political statements. While GPT-2 expresses support for \"tax the rich\", GPT-3 Ada and Davinci are clearly against it. Similar disagreements are observed regarding the role of women in the workforce, democratic governments, and the social responsibility of corporations.\n\n### The Effect of Pretraining with Partisan Corpora\n\nFigure 3 shows the re-evaluated political leaning of RoBERTa and GPT-2 after being further pretrained with 6 partisan pretraining corpora (SS3):\n\n* LMs _do_ acquire political bias from pretraining corpora. Left-leaning corpora generally resulted in a left/liberal shift on the political compass, while right-leaning corpora led to a right/conservative shift from the checkpoint. This is particularly noticeable for RoBERTa further pretrained on Reddit-left, which resulted in a substantial liberal shift in terms of social values (\\(2.97\\) to \\(-3.03\\)). However, most of the ideological shifts are relatively small, suggesting that it is hard to alter the inherent bias present in initial pretrained LMs. We hypothesize that this may be due to differences in the size and training time of the pretraining corpus, which we further explore when we examine hyperpartisan LMs.\n* For RoBERTa, the social media corpus led to an average change of 1.60 in social values, while the news media corpus resulted in a change of 0.64. For economic values, the changes were 0.90 and 0.61 for news and social media, respectively. User-generated texts on social media have a greater influence on the social values of LMs, while news media has a greater influence on economic values. We speculate that this can be attributed to the difference in coverage (Cacciatore et al., 2012; Guggenheim et al., 2015): while news media often reports on economic issues (Ballon, 2014), political discussions on social media tend to focus more on controversial \"culture wars\" and social issues (Amedie, 2015).\n\n#### Pre-Trump vs. Post-Trump\n\nNews and social media are timely reflections of the current sentiment of society, and there is evidence (Abramowitz and McCoy, 2019; Galvin, 2020; Hout and Maggio, 2021) suggesting that polarization is at an all-time high since the election of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. To examine whether our framework detects the increased polarization in the general public, we add a pre- and post-Trump dimension to our partisan corpora by further partitioning the 6 pretraining corpora into pre- and post-January 20, 2017. We then pretrain the RoBERTa and GPT-2 checkpoints with the pre- and post-Trump corpora respectively. Figure 2 demonstrates that LMs indeed pick up the heightened polarization present in pretraining corpora, resulting in LMs positioned further away from the center. In addition to this general trend, for RoBERTa and the Reddit-right corpus, the post-Trump LM is more economically left than the pre-Trump counterpart. Similar results are observed for GPT-2 and the News-right corpus. This may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but we speculate that it provides preliminary evidence that LMs could also detect the anti-establishment sentiment regarding economic issues among right-leaning communities, similarly observed as the Sanders-Trump voter phenomenon (Bump, 2016; Trudell, 2016).\n\n#### Examining the Potential of Hyperpartisan LMs\n\nSince pretrained LMs could move further away from the center due to further pretraining on partisan corpora, it raises a concern about dual use: _training a hyperpartisan LM_ and employing it to further deepen societal divisions. We hypothesize that this might be achieved by pretraining for more epochs and with more partisan data. To test this, we further pretrain the RoBERTa checkpoint with more epochs and larger corpus size and examine the trajectory on the political compass. Figure 4 demonstrates that, fortunately, this simple strategy is _not_ resulting in increasingly partisan LMs: on economic issues, LMs remain close to the center; on social issues, we observe that while pretraining does lead to some changes, training with more data\n\nFigure 4: The trajectory of LM political leaning with increasing pretraining corpus size and epochs.\n\nfor more epochs is not enough to push the models' scores towards the polar extremes of \\(10\\) or \\(-10\\).\n\n### Political Leaning and Downstream Tasks\n\nOverall PerformanceWe compare the performance of five models: base RoBERTa and four RoBERTa models further pretrained with Reddit-left, News-left, Reddit-right, and News-right corpora, respectively. Table 3 presents the overall performance on hate speech and misinformation detection, which demonstrates that left-leaning LMs generally slightly outperform right-leaning LMs. The Reddit-right corpus is especially detrimental to downstream task performance, greatly trailing the vanilla RoBERTa without partisan pretraining. The results demonstrate that the political leaning of the pretraining corpus could have a tangible impact on overall task performance.\n\nPerformance Breakdown by CategoriesIn addition to aggregated performance, we investigate how the performance of partisan models vary for different targeted identity groups (e.g., Women, LGBTQ+) and different sources of misinformation (e.g., CNN, Fox). Table 4 illustrates a notable variation in the behavior of models based on their political bias. In particular, for hate speech detection, models with left-leaning biases exhibit better performance towards hate speech directed at widely-regarded minority groups such as lgbtq+ and black, while models with right-leaning biases tend to perform better at identifying hate speech targeting dominant identity groups such as men and white. For misinformation detection, left-leaning LMs are more stringent with misinformation from right-leaning media but are less sensitive to misinformation from left-leaning sources such as CNN and NYT. Right-leaning LMs show the opposite pattern. These results highlight the concerns regarding the amplification of political biases in pretraining data within LMs, which subsequently propagate into downstream tasks and directly impact model (un)fairness.\n\nTable 5 provides further qualitative analysis and examples that illustrate distinctive behaviors exhibited by pretrained LMs with different political leanings. Right-leaning LMs overlook racist accusations of \"race mixing with asians,\" whereas left-leaning LMs correctly identify such instances as hate speech. In addition, both left- and right-leaning LMs demonstrate double standards for misinformation regarding the inaccuracies in comments made by Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.\n\n## 5 Reducing the Effect of Political Bias\n\nOur findings demonstrate that political bias can lead to significant issues of fairness. Models with different political biases have different predictions\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c c c c|c c c} \\hline \\hline Hate Speech & BLACK & MUSLIM & LGBTQ+ & JEWS & ASAIN & LATINX & WOMEN & CHRISTAN & MEN & WHITE \\\\ \\hline news\\_left & 89.94 & 89.98 & 80.19 & 89.95 & 89.35 & 91.28 & 86.81 & 87.82 & 85.83 & 86.22 \\\\ reddit\\_left & 89.84 & 89.90 & 89.96 & 89.50 & 90.66 & 91.15 & 87.42 & 87.65 & 86.20 & 85.13 \\\\ news\\_right & 88.81 & 88.68 & 88.91 & 89.74 & 90.62 & 89.97 & 86.41 & 86.02 & 84.50 & 86.35 \\\\ reddit\\_right & 88.03 & 89.26 & 88.43 & 89.00 & 89.72 & 89.31 & 88.76 & 87.65 & 86.50 & 86.50 \\\\ \\hline Misinformation & HP (\\(\\downarrow\\)) & NYT (\\(\\downarrow\\)) & CNN (\\(\\downarrow\\)) & NPR (\\(\\downarrow\\)) & Guard (\\(\\downarrow\\)) & Fox (R) & Wax (R) & Bbart (R) & Wat (R) & NR (R) \\\\ \\hline news\\_left & 89.44 & 86.08 & 87.57 & 89.61 & 82.22 & 93.10 & 92.86 & 91.30 & 82.35 & 96.30 \\\\ reddit\\_left & 88.73 & 88.54 & 84.98 & 92.21 & 84.44 & 86.66 & 94.33 & 86.93 & 91.18 & 96.30 \\\\ news\\_right & 89.46 & 88.71 & 89.19 & 90.81 & 86.67 & 88.51 & 87.18 & 83.25 & 92.70 \\\\ reddit\\_right & 90.85 & 86.71 & 90.81 & 83.42 & 81.44 & 91.95 & 96.42 & 84.78 & 85.29 & 96.30 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Performance on hate speech targeting different identity groups and misinformation from different sources.

For example, if a content moderation model for detecting hate speech is more sensitive to offensive content directed at men than women, it can result in women being exposed to more toxic content. Similarly, if a misinformation detection model is excessively sensitive to one side of a story and detects misinformation from that side more frequently, it can create a skewed representation of the overall situation. We discuss two strategies to mitigate the impact of political bias in LMs.\n\nPartisan EnsembleThe experiments in Section 4.2 show that LMs with different political biases behave differently and have different strengths and weaknesses when applied to downstream tasks. Motivated by existing literature on analyzing different political perspectives in downstream tasks Akhtar et al. (2020); Flores-Saviaga et al. (2022), we propose using a combination, or ensemble, of pretrained LMs with different political leanings to take advantage of their collective knowledge for downstream tasks. By incorporating multiple LMs representing different perspectives, we can introduce a range of viewpoints into the decision-making process, instead of relying solely on a single perspective represented by a single language model. We evaluate a partisan ensemble approach and report the results in Table 6, which demonstrate that partisan ensemble actively engages diverse political perspectives, leading to improved model performance. However, it is important to note that this approach may incur additional computational cost and may require human evaluation to resolve differences.\n\nStrategic PretrainingAnother finding is that LMs are more sensitive towards hate speech and misinformation from political perspectives that differ from their own. For example, a model becomes better at identifying factual inconsistencies from New York Times news when it is pretrained with corpora from right-leaning sources.\n\nThis presents an opportunity to create models tailored to specific scenarios. For example, in a downstream task focused on detecting hate speech from white supremacy groups, it might be beneficial to further pretrain LMs on corpora from communities that are more critical of white supremacy. Strategic pretraining might have great improvements in specific scenarios, but curating ideal scenario-specific pretraining corpora may pose challenges.\n\nOur work opens up a new avenue for identifying the inherent political bias of LMs and further study\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{**Model**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**Hate-Identity**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**Hate-Demographic**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**Misinformation**} \\\\ \\cline{2-7}  & **BACC** & **F1** & **BACC** & **F1** & **BACC** & **F1** \\\\ \\hline avg. uni-model & \\(88.58\\)(\\(\\pm 0.2\\)) & \\(81.01\\)(\\(\\pm 0.7\\)) & \\(89.83\\)(\\(\\pm 0.4\\)) & \\(83.35\\)(\\(\\pm 0.5\\)) & \\(87.24\\)(\\(\\pm 1.2\\)) & \\(86,54\\)(\\(\\pm 1.4\\)) \\\\ best uni-model & \\(88.78\\) & \\(81.77\\) & \\(90.19\\) & \\(83.82\\) & \\(88.61\\) & \\(88.15\\) \\\\ partisan ensemble & \\(\\mathbf{90.21}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{83.57}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{91.84}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{86.16}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{90.88}\\) & \\(\\mathbf{90.50}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: Performance of best and average single models and partisan ensemble on hate speech and misinformation detection.

(2014); Makazhanov and Rafiei (2013); Preotiuc-Pietro et al. (2017), news articles Li and Goldwasser (2019); Feng et al. (2021); Liu et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022), and political entities Anegundi et al. (2022); Feng et al. (2022). As extensive research has shown that machine learning models exhibit societal and political biases Zhao et al. (2018); Blodgett et al. (2020); Bender et al. (2021); Ghosh et al. (2021); Shaikh et al. (2022); Li et al. (2022); Cao et al. (2022); Goldfarb-Tarrant et al. (2021); Jin et al. (2021), there has been an increasing amount of research dedicated to measuring the inherent societal bias of these models using various components, such as word embeddings Bolukbasi et al. (2016); Caliskan et al. (2017); Kurita et al. (2019), output probability Borkan et al. (2019), and model performance discrepancy Hardt et al. (2016).\n\nRecently, as generative models have become increasingly popular, several studies have proposed to probe political biases Liu et al. (2021); Jiang et al. (2022) and prudence Bang et al. (2021) of these models. Liu et al. (2021) presented two metrics to quantify political bias in GPT2 using a political ideology classifier, which evaluate the probability difference of generated text with and without attributes (gender, location, and topic). Jiang et al. (2022) showed that LMs trained on corpora written by active partisan members of a community can be used to examine the perspective of the community and generate community-specific responses to elicit opinions about political entities. Our proposed method is distinct from existing methods as it can be applied to a wide range of LMs including encoder-based models, not just autoregressive models. Additionally, our approach for measuring political bias is informed by existing political science literature and widely-used standard tests.\n\nImpact of Model and Data Bias on Downstream Task FairnessPrevious research has shown that the performance of models for downstream tasks can vary greatly among different identity groups Hovy and Sogaard (2015); Buolamwini and Gebru (2018); Dixon et al. (2018), highlighting the issue of fairness Hutchinson and Mitchell (2019); Liu et al. (2020). It is commonly believed that annotator Geva et al. (2019); Sap et al. (2019); Davani et al. (2022); Sap et al. (2022) and data bias Park et al. (2018); Dixon et al. (2018); Dodge et al. (2021); Harris et al. (2022) are the cause of this impact, and some studies have investigated the connection between training data and downstream task model behavior Gonen and Webster (2020); Li et al. (2020); Dodge et al. (2021). Our study adds to this by demonstrating the effects of political bias in training data on downstream tasks, specifically in terms of fairness. Previous studies have primarily examined the connection between data bias and either model bias or downstream task performance, with the exception of Steed et al. (2022). Our study, however, takes a more thorough approach by linking data bias to model bias, and then to downstream task performance, in order to gain a more complete understanding of the effect of social biases on the fairness of models for downstream tasks. Also, most prior work has primarily focused on investigating fairness in hate speech detection models, but our study highlights important fairness concerns in misinformation detection that require further examination.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nWe conduct a systematic analysis of the political biases of language models. We probe LMs using prompts grounded in political science and measure models' ideological positions on social and economic values. We also examine the influence of political biases in pretraining data on the political leanings of LMs and investigate the model performance with varying political biases on downstream tasks, finding that LMs may have different standards for different hate speech targets and misinformation sources based on their political biases.\n\nOur work highlights that pernicious biases and unfairness in downstream tasks can be caused by non-toxic data, which includes diverse opinions, but there are subtle imbalances in data distributions. Prior work discussed data filtering or augmentation techniques as a remedy Kaushik et al. (2019); while useful in theory, these approaches might not be applicable in real-world settings, running the risk of censorship and exclusion from political participation. In addition to identifying these risks, we discuss strategies to mitigate the negative impacts while preserving the diversity of opinions in pretraining data.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe Political Compass TestIn this work, we leveraged the political compass test as a test bed to probe the underlying political leaning of pretrained language models. While the political compass test is a widely adopted and straightforward toolkit, it is far from perfect and has several limitations: 1) In addition to a two-axis political spectrum on social and economic values (Eysenck, 1957), there are numerous political science theories (Blattberg, 2001; Horrell, 2005; Diamond and Wolf, 2017) that support other ways of categorizing political ideologies. 2) The political compass test focuses heavily on the ideological issues and debates of the western world, while the political landscape is far from homogeneous around the globe. (Hudson, 1978) 3) There are several criticisms of the political compass test: unclear scoring schema, libertarian bias, and vague statement formulation (Utley, 2001; Mitchell, 2007). However, we present a general methodology to probe the political leaning of LMs that is compatible with any ideological theories, tests, and questionnaires. We encourage readers to use our approach along with other ideological theories and tests for a more well-rounded evaluation.\n\nProbing Language ModelsFor encoder-based language models, our approach of mask in-filling is widely adopted in numerous existing works (Petroni et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2022). For language generation models, we curate prompts, conduct prompted text generation, and employ a BART-based stance detector for response evaluation. An alternative approach would be to explicitly frame it as a multi-choice question in the prompt, forcing pretrained language models to choose from strong agree, agree, disagree, and strong disagree. These two approaches have their respective pros and cons: our approach is compatible with all LMs that support text generation and is more interpretable, while the response mapping and the stance detector could be more subjective and rely on empirical hyperparameter settings; multi-choice questions offer direct and unequivocal answers, while being less interpretable and does not work well with LMs with fewer parameters such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019).\n\nFine-Grained Political Leaning AnalysisIn this work, we \"force\" each pretrained LM into its position on a two-dimensional space based on their responses to social and economic issues. However, political leaning could be more fine-grained than two numerical values: being liberal on one issue does not necessarily exclude the possibility of being conservative on another, and vice versa. We leave it to future work on how to achieve a more fine-grained understanding of LM political leaning in a topic- and issue-specific manner.\n\n## Ethics Statement\n\nU.S.-Centric PerspectivesThe authors of this work are based in the U.S., and our framing in this work, e.g., references to minority identity groups, reflects this context. This viewpoint is not universally applicable and may vary in different contexts and cultures.\n\nMisuse PotentialIn this paper, we showed that hyperpartisan LMs are not simply achieved by pretraining on more partisan data for more epochs. However, this preliminary finding does not exclude the possibility of future malicious attempts at creating hyperpartisan language models, and some might even succeed. Training and employing hyperpartisan LMs might contribute to many malicious purposes, such as propagating partisan misinformation or adversarially attacking pretrained language models (Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov, 2022). We will refrain from releasing the trained hyperpartisan language model checkpoints and will establish access permission for the collected partisan pretraining corpora to ensure its research-only usage.\n\nInterpreting Downstream Task PerformanceWhile we showed that pretrained LMs with different political leanings could have different performances and behaviors on downstream tasks, this empirical evidence should not be taken as a judgment of individuals and communities with certain political leanings, rather than a mere reflection of the empirical behavior of pretrained LMs.\n\nAuthors' Political LeaningAlthough the authors strive to conduct politically impartial analysis throughout the paper, it is not impossible that our inherent political leaning has impacted experiment interpretation and analysis in unperceived ways. We encourage the readers to also examine the models and results by themselves, or at least be aware of this possibility.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank the reviewers, the area chair, Anjalie Field, Lucille Njoo, Vidhisha Balachandran, Sebastin Santy, Sneha Kudugunta, Melanie Sclar, and other members of Tsvetshop, and the UW NLP Group for their feedback.

(2019) and RoBERTa Liu et al. (2019)). Specifically, we retrieve the top-10 probable token for mask filling, aggregate the probability of positive and negative words, and set a threshold to map them to {strong disagree, disagree, agree, strong agree}. A complete list of positive and negative words adopted is presented in Table 7, which is obtained after manually examining the output probabilities of 100 examples. We then compare the probability of positive words and negative words to settle agree v.s. disagreeee, then normalize and use 0.3 in probability difference as a threshold for whether that response is strongly or not.\n\n### Decoder-Based LMs\n\nWe use prompted text generation and a stance detector to evaluate the political leaning of decoder-based language models (e.g. GPT-2 Radford et al. (2019) and GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020)). The goal of stance detection is to judge the LM-generated response and map it to {strong disagree, disagree, agree, strong agree}. To this end, we employed the facebook/bart-large-mnli checkpoint on Huggingface Transformers, which is BART Lewis et al. (2019) fine-tuned on the multiNLI dataset Williams et al. (2018), to initialize a zero-shot classification pipeline of agree and disagree, evaluating whether the response _entails_ agreement or disagreement. We further conduct a human evaluation of the stance detector: we\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{42.7pt} p{341.4pt}} \\hline \\hline\n**Category** & **Tokens** \\\\ \\hline\n**positive** & agree, agrees, agreeing, agreed, support, supports, supported, supporting, believe, believes, believed, believing, accept, accepts, accepted, accepting, approve, approves, approved, approving, endorse, endorsed, endorsing \\\\ \\hline\n**negative** & disagree, disagrees, disagreeing, disagreed, oppose, opposing, opposed, deny, denies, denying, denied, refuse, refuses, refused, reject, rejects, rejecting, rejected, disapproves, disapproved \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 7: List of positive (supporting a statement) and negative (disagreeing with a statement) words.\n\nselect 110 LM-generated responses, annotate the responses, and compare the human annotations with the results of the stance detector. The three annotators are graduate students in the U.S., with prior knowledge both in NLP and U.S. politics. This human evaluation answers a few key questions:\n\n* Do language models provide clear responses to political propositions? **Yes**, since 80 of the 110 LM responses provide responses with a clear stance. The Fleiss' Kappa of annotation agreement is 0.85, which signals strong agreement among annotators regarding the stance of LM responses.\n* Is the stance detector accurate? **Yes**, on the 80 LM responses with a clear stance, the BART-based stance detector has an accuracy of 97%. This indicates that the stance detector is reliable in judging the agreement of LM-generated responses.\n* How do we deal with unclear LM responses? We observed that the 30 unclear responses have an average stance detection confidence of 0.76, while the 80 unclear responses have an average confidence of 0.90. This indicates that the stance detector's confidence could serve as a heuristic to filter out unclear responses. As a result, we retrieve the top-10 probable LM responses, remove the ones with lower than 0.9 confidence, and aggregate the scores of the remaining responses.\n\nTo sum up, we present a reliable framework to probe the political leaning of pretrained language models. We commit to making the code and data publicly available upon acceptance to facilitate the evaluation of new and emerging LMs.\n\n## Appendix B Recall and Precision\n\nFollowing previous works Sap et al. (2019), we additionally report false positives and false negatives through precision and recall in Table 12.\n\n## Appendix C Experiment Details\n\nWe provide details about specific language model checkpoints used in this work in Table 10. We present the dataset statistics for the social media corpora in Table 8, while we refer readers to Liu et al. (2022) for the statistics of the news media corpora.\n\n## Appendix D Stability Analysis\n\nPretrained language models are sensitive to minor changes and perturbations in the input text Li et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2021), which may in turn lead to instability in the political leaning measuring process. In the experiments, we made minor edits to the prompt formulation in order to best elicit political opinions of diverse language models. We further examine whether the political opinion of language models stays stable in the face of changes in prompts and political statements. Specifically, we design 6 more prompts to investigate the sensitivity toward prompts. We similarly use 6 paraphrasing models to paraphrase the political propositions and investigate the sensitivity towards paraphrasing. We present the results of four LMs in Figure 5, which illustrates that GPT-3 DaVinci Brown et al. (2020) provides the most consistent responses, while the political opinions of all pretrained LMs are moderately stable.\n\nWe further evaluate the stability of LM political leaning with respect to minor changes in prompts. We write 7 different prompts formats, prompt LMs separately, and present the results in Figure 6. It is demonstrated that GPT-3 DaVinci provides the most consistent responses towards prompt changes, while the political opinions of all pretrained LMs are moderately stable.\n\nFor paraphrasing, we adopted three models: Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws based on T5 Raffel et al. (2020), eugenesiow/bart\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Learning** & **Size** & **avg. \\# token** & **Pre/Post-Trump** \\\\ \\hline Left & 796,939 & 44.50 & 237,525 / 558,125 \\\\ Center & 952,152 & 34.67 & 417,454 / 534,698 \\\\ Right & 934,452 & 50.43 & 374,673 / 558,400 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 8: Statistics of the collected social media corpora.

For prompts, we present the 7 manually designed prompts in Table 11.\n\nFootnote 9: [https://quillbot.com/](https://quillbot.com/)\n\nFootnote 10: [https://www.editpad.org/](https://www.editpad.org/)\n\nFootnote 11: [https://www.paraphraser.io/](https://www.paraphraser.io/)\n\n## Appendix E Qualitative Analysis (cont.)\n\nWe conduct qualitative analysis and present more hate speech examples where pretrained LMs with different political leanings beg to differ. Table 14 presents more examples for hate speech detection. It is demonstrated that pretrained LMs with different political leanings _do_ have vastly different behavior facing hate speech targeting different identities.\n\n## Appendix F Hyperparameter Settings\n\nWe further pretrained LM checkpoints on partisan corpora and fine-tuned them on downstream tasks. We present hyperparameters for the pretraining and fine-tuning stage in Table 9. We mostly follow the hyperparameters in Gururangan et al. (2020) for the pretraining stage. The default hyperparameters on Huggingface Transformers are adopted if not included in Table 9.\n\n## Appendix G Computational Resources\n\nWe used a GPU cluster with 16 NVIDIA A40 GPUs, 1988G memory, and 104 CPU cores for the experiments. Pretraining roberta-base and GPT-2 on the partisan pretraining corpora takes approximately 48 and 83 hours. Fine-tuning the partisan LMs takes approximately 30 and 20 minutes for the hate speech detection and misinformation identification datasets.\n\n## Appendix H Scientific Artifacts\n\nWe leveraged many open-source scientific artifacts in this work, including pytorch Paszke et al. (2019), pytorch lightning (Falcon and The PyTorch Lightning team, 2019), HuggingFace transformers Wolf et al. (2020), sklearn Pedregosa et al. (2011), NumPy Harris et al. (2020), NLTK Bird et al. (2009), and the PushShift API 12. We commit to making our code and data publicly available upon acceptance to facilitate reproduction and further research.\n\nFootnote 12:

Backpacks learn multiple non-contextual sense vectors for each word in a vocabulary, and represent a word in a sequence as a context-dependent, non-negative linear combination of sense vectors in this sequence. We find that, after training, sense vectors specialize, each encoding a different aspect of a word. We can interpret a sense vector by inspecting its (non-contextual, linear) projection onto the output space, and intervene on these interpretable hooks to change the model\u2019s behavior in predictable ways. We train a 170M-parameter Backpack language model on OpenWebText, matching the loss of a GPT-2 small (124Mparameter) Transformer. On lexical similarity evaluations, we find that Backpack sense vectors outperform even a 6B-parameter Transformer LM\u2019s word embeddings. Finally, we present simple algorithms that intervene on sense vectors to perform controllable text generation and debiasing. For example, we can edit the sense vocabulary to tend more towards a topic, or localize a source of gender bias to a sense vector and globally suppress that sense.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nConsider the prefix _The CEO believes that_, and the problem of debiasing a neural language model's distribution over _he/she_. Intuitively, the bias for _he_ originates in the word _CEO_, because replacing _CEO_ with _nurse_ flips the observed bias. A successful intervention to debias _CEO_ must reliably apply in all contexts in which the word _CEO_ appears; ideally we would want to make a **non-contextual** change to the model that has predictable effects in **all contexts**. In general, in all aspects of interpretability and control, it is desirable to make interventions with a tractable interface (e.g., non-contextual representations) that apply globally.\n\nSuch interventions are difficult in Transformer models [20] because their contextual representations are monolithic functions of their input. Almost any intervention on the model has complex, non-linear effects that depend on context. We would instead like models that enable precise, rich interventions that apply predictably in all contexts, and are still expressive, so they are a viable alternative to Transformers.\n\nWe address these challenges with a new neural architecture, the _Backpack_, for which predictions are log-linear combinations of non-contextual representations. We represent each word in a vocabulary as a set of non-contextual _sense vectors_ that represent distinct learned aspects of the word. For example, sense vectors for the word \"science\" could encode types of science, connections to technology, notions of science being \"settled,\" or different aspects of the scientific process (replication or experiment) (Table 1). Sense vectors do not learn classic word sense, but more general aspects of a word's potential roles in different contexts; in fact, they can be seen as a multi-vector generalization of classic word vectors [15].1\n\nFigure 1: Transformers are monolithic functions of sequences. In Backpacks, the output is a weighted sum of non-contextual, learned word aspects.\n\nTo make interventions on sense vectors behave predictably in different contexts, a Backpack represents each word in a sequence as a **linear combination** of the sense vectors for all words in the sequence. The expressivity of a Backpack comes from the network that computes the weights of the linear combination as a function of the whole sequence; for example, in all our experiments we use a Transformer for this. Since sense vectors are softly selected depending on the context, they can specialize; each sense can learn to be predictively useful in only some contexts. The log-linear contribution of senses to predictions then implies that the interventions on sense vectors we demonstrate in Section 6 apply identically (up to a non-negative scalar weight) regardless of context.\n\nOur experiments demonstrate the expressivity of Backpack language models, and the promise of interventions on sense vectors for interpretability and control. In Section 4 we train Backpack language models on 50B tokens (5 epochs) of OpenWebText; a Backpack with 124M parameters in the contextual network (and 46M parameters for sense vectors) achieves the perplexity of a 124M-parameter Transformer; thus one pays for more interpretability with a larger model size. In Section 5, we show that sense vectors specialize to encode rich notions of word meaning. Quantitatively, on four lexical similarity datasets (e.g., SimLex999), sense vectors of a 170M parameter Backpack outperform word embeddings of the 6B-parameter GPT-J-6B Transformer, and approach the performance of state-of-the-art specialized methods for this task. Finally, in Section 6 we show that sense vectors offer a control mechanism for Backpack language models. For example, stereotypically gendered profession words (e.g., \"CEO\" or \"nurse\") tend to learn a sense vector associated with this gender bias; by downscaling this sense vector, we greatly reduce disparity in contextual predictions in a limited setting.\n\n## 2 The Backpack Architecture\n\nIn this section, we define the general form of the Backpack architecture. We then show how continuous bag-of-words word2vec (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013) and Self-Attention-Only networks (Elmage et al., 2021; Olsson et al., 2022) are special cases of Backpacks.\n\n### Backpack General Form\n\nA Backpack is a parametric function that maps a sequence of symbols \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}=(\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{n})\\) to a sequence of vectors \\(\\mathbf{o}_{1:n}=(\\mathbf{o}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{o}_{n})\\), where each symbol \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\) belongs to a finite vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{o}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\). We call \\(\\mathbf{o}_{i}\\) the _Backpack representation_ of \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\) in the context of a sequence \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}\\).\n\nSense vectors.For each \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{V}\\), a Backpack constructs \\(k\\)_sense_ vectors\n\n\\[C(\\mathbf{x})_{1},\\ldots,C(\\mathbf{x})_{k}, \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(C:\\mathcal{V}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times d}\\). Sense vectors are a multi-vector analog to classic non-contextual word representations like word2vec or GloVe: we make this analogy precise in Section 2.2.\n\nWeighted sum.For a sequence \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}\\), the representation \\(\\mathbf{o}_{i}\\) of element \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\) is a weighted sum of the predictive sense vectors for the words in its context: given _contextualization weights_\\(\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times n\\times n}\\),\n\n\\[\\mathbf{o}_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k}\\alpha_{\\ell ij}C(\\mathbf{x}_{j} )_{\\ell}. \\tag{2}\\]\n\nThe contextualization weights \\(\\alpha_{\\ell ij}\\) of a Backpack are themselves defined by a (non-linear) _contextualization function_ of the entire sequence \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}\\):\n\n\\[\\alpha=A(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}), \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwhere \\(A:\\mathcal{V}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times n\\times n}\\).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{c}{A few senses of the word _science_} \\\\ \\hline \\hline Sense 3 & Sense 7 & Sense 9 & Sense 10 & Sense 8 \\\\ \\hline fiction & replication & religion & settled & clones \\\\ fictional & citation & rology & sett & experiments \\\\ Fiction & Hubble & hydra & settle & mage \\\\ literacy & reprodu & religions & unsett & experiment \\\\ denial & Discovery & nec & Sett & rats \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \n\\begin{tabular}{c} \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{c}{_MacBook\\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\)r \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\Delta}}\\)**MacBook \\(\\boldsymbol{-}\\)**Apple \\(\\boldsymbol{+}\\)**HP**} \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{c}{_The MacBook is best known for its form factor, but HP has continued with its Linux-based computing strategy.

Like a bag-of-words, a Backpack representation is a sum of non-contextual senses; but a Backpack is more orderly, because the weights in this sum depend on the ordered sequence.\n\nBackpack Models.A _Backpack model_ is a probabilistic model that defines probabilities over some output space \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) as a log-linear function of a Backpack representation \\(\\mathbf{o}_{1:n}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\):\n\n\\[p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{o}_{1:n})=\\text{softmax}\\left(E(\\mathbf{o}_{1:n})\\right), \\tag{4}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathcal{Y}\\) and \\(E:\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{Y}|}\\) is a linear transformation. Because Backpack models are log-linear in their representations, the sense vectors contribute log-linearly to predictions. This allows us to inspect a sense vector by projecting it onto the vocabulary via \\(E\\) and observe exactly how it will contribute to predictions in any context.\n\nModels parameterized by the prevailing deep neural architectures--including LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and Transformers--are not Backpacks because their output representations are (relatively) unconstrained functions of the entire sequence. By contrast, Backpack models may seem limited in expressivity: the representations \\(\\mathbf{o}_{i}\\) are scalar-weighted sums of non-contextual vectors \\(C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}\\). Contextual relationships between sequence elements can only be expressed through the weights \\(\\alpha=A(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n})\\). Nevertheless, our experiments show that an expressive contextualization weight network can represent complex functions by weighted sums of sense vectors, e.g., our 170M parameter Backpack LM uses a 124M-parameter Transformer to compute \\(\\alpha\\), and achieves the loss of a 124M-parameter Transformer LM.\n\nTo place Backpacks in some historical context, we now show how two existing architectures can be described as Backpacks.\n\n### Continuous Bag-of-Words is a Backpack\n\nThe continuous bag-of-words word2vec model defines a probability distribution over a center word \\(\\mathbf{x}_{c}\\in\\mathcal{V}\\) conditioned on \\(n\\) context words \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}\\).2 The model proceeds to (1) construct vector embeddings \\(\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{x}}\\) for each \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{V}\\), and (2) uniformly average the embeddings of the context words to predict the center word:\n\nFootnote 2: Context in this setting is usually defined as words surrounding the center word.\n\n\\[\\overline{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathbf{x}_{c}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{n} \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{x}_{i}}, \\tag{5}\\] \\[p(\\mathbf{x}_{c}\\mid\\mathbf{x}_{1:n})=\\text{softmax}(U\\overline{ \\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathbf{x}_{c}}), \\tag{6}\\]\n\nwhere \\(U\\in\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{V}\\times d}\\). We see that \\(\\overline{\\mathbf{v}}_{\\mathbf{x}_{c}}\\) is a Backpack representation by setting \\(C(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{x}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times d}\\) in Equation (1) using a single sense vector (\\(k=1\\)) and setting the contextualization weights in Equation (3) to be uniform: \\(\\alpha_{\\ell ij}=\\frac{1}{n}\\).\n\nThis connection to CBoW foreshadows the emergence of linguistic structures in the predictive sense vectors of Backpack models, just as these structures emerge in CBoW (Mikolov et al., 2013).\n\n### Single-Layer Self-Attention is a Backpack\n\nThe Backpack structure--define sense vectors (values), and use the sequence to determine how to sum them (weights)--may remind the reader of a single layer of self-attention. The key-query-value self-attention function is as follows:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{o}_{j} =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k}\\alpha_{\\ell ij}OV^{(\\ell)}\\mathbf{ x}_{j} \\tag{7}\\] \\[\\alpha_{\\ell} =\\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{x}^{\\top}K^{(\\ell)\\top}Q^{(\\ell)}\\mathbf{ x}), \\tag{8}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\) is (overloaded) to be a non-contextual embedding of the sequence, \\(O\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d/k}\\), and \\(V^{(\\ell)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d/k\\times d}\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of attention heads. The self-attention function is a Backpack with \\(C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}=OV^{(\\ell)}\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\). Self-attention-only networks are studied in the context of, e.g., mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021). A Transformer composes blocks of self-attention and non-linear feed-forward layers that combine information from the whole sequence; unlike a Transformer, the contextualization weights of a Backpack each select a non-contextual sense of a single word.\n\n## 3 Language Modeling with Backpacks\n\nIn this section, we define a neural autoregressive language model parameterized by a Backpack. We use the standard softmax parameterization of the probability over the next token in a sequence, with a weight matrix \\(E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times|\\mathcal{V}|}\\) that maps a representation \\(\\mathbf{o}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) to logits \\(E^{\\top}\\mathbf{o}_{j}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}\\):\n\n\\[p(\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\mid\\mathbf{x}_{1:j-1})=\\text{softmax}(E^{\\top}\\mathbf{o}_{j}). \\tag{9}\\]Recall (Section 2.1) that Backpack representations \\(\\mathbf{o}_{j}\\) are defined by sense vectors \\(C(\\mathbf{x})\\) and contextualization weights \\(\\alpha_{j}\\). In Section 3.1 we describe a parameterization of \\(C\\) for the predictive sense vectors in Equation (1), and in Section 3.2 we describe a parameterization of \\(A\\) for the contextualization weight network in Equation (3). When \\(\\mathbf{o}_{j}\\) is parameterized by a Backpack, we call a model of the form given by Equation (9) a _Backpack LM_.\n\n### Parameterizing senses\n\nFor the sense function \\(C:\\mathcal{V}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times d}\\), we embed each \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathcal{V}\\) into \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) and pass these embeddings though a feed-forward network \\(\\text{FF}:\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times d}\\):\n\n\\[C(\\mathbf{x})=\\text{FF}(E\\mathbf{x}), \\tag{10}\\]\n\nwhere the embedding/projection matrix \\(E\\) is tied to the output matrix in Equation (9) (Press and Wolf, 2017). Note that we could define all \\(k\\times|\\mathcal{V}|\\) sense vectors using a lookup table, but this would be an enormous number of parameters as \\(k\\) grows large. Instead, we embed the words as \\(E\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\), and then blow them up to \\(\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}\\) using shared weights. This may explain the related sense roles observed for different word types in Section 5.1.\n\n### Parameterizing contextualization weights\n\nWe parameterize \\(A:\\mathcal{V}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{k\\times n\\times n}\\) using a standard Transformer, followed by a layer of multi-headed key-query self-attention. That is, we pass an embedded sequence through a Transformer\n\n\\[\\mathbf{h}_{1:n}=\\text{Transformer}(E\\mathbf{x}_{1:n}) \\tag{11}\\]\n\n(with proper autoregressive masking and some position representation) and compute \\(A(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n})=\\alpha\\), where\n\n\\[\\alpha_{\\ell}=\\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{h}_{1:n}K^{(\\ell)\\top}Q^{(\\ell)}\\mathbf{h }_{1:n}^{\\top}), \\tag{12}\\]\n\nfor each predictive sense \\(\\ell=1,\\ldots,k\\) with matrices \\(K^{(\\ell)},Q^{(\\ell)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d/k}\\). We can think of the \\(k\\) senses as heads and, for each head, the contextualization weights define a distribution of attention over words.3\n\nFootnote 3: Note that the sense weights are normalized (1) independently for each sense, and (2) to sum to one over the sequence length.\n\n## 4 Experiments Training Backpack LMs\n\nIn this section we specify the hyperparameters used to train Backpack and Transformer language models (Section 4.1), data and optimization procedure (Section 4.2), evaluations (Section 4.3) and results (Section 4.4). We also show the necessity of learning \\(k>1\\) sense vectors to achieve strong language modeling performance (Section 4.5).\n\n### Models\n\nWe train three Transformer baseline models, which we label Micro (30M parameters), Mini (70M parameters), and Small (124M parameters; the same size as GPT-2 small). We also train Micro (40M), Mini (100M), and Small (170M) Backpack language models, for which the weighting function (Equation 11) is parameterized using the corresponding Transformer, and almost all extra parameters are in the non-contextual sense vectors.4 Backpacks thus cost extra parameters and compute beyond their underlying contextualization network. Except where stated, we use \\(k=16\\) sense vectors in all Backpacks (Section A).\n\nFootnote 4: There are a negligible number of additional parameters in the final key-query Backpack operation (Equation 12)).\n\nWe use a reduced sequence length of 512 for all models, and the 50,257-subword GPT-2 tokenizer. Model hidden dimensionalities, layer counts, and head counts are reported in Table 9.\n\n### Data & Optimization\n\nWe train all models on OpenWebText (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019), a publicly available approximate reconstruction of the English WebText corpus used to train the GPT-2 family of models (Radford et al., 2019). We use a batch size of 524,288 tokens, and train all models for 100,000 gradient steps for a total of 52B tokens; training for longer is known to make marginal difference for small models (Hoffmann et al., 2022). The size of OpenWebText means this is roughly 5 epochs. We use cross-entropy loss and the AdamW optimizer, with a warmup of 5,000 steps and linear decay to zero.\n\n### Evaluations\n\nBefore our experiments in interpretability and control, we check the expressivity of Backpacks. We evaluate models on perplexity for a held out set of OpenWebText, perplexity and accuracy for the (OpenAI variant of) LAMBADA evaluation of long-distance dependencies (Radford et al., 2019; Paperno et al., 2016), perplexity on Wikitext (Merity et al., 2017), and BLiMP English linguistic competence accuracy (Warstadt et al., 2020) evaluated using the EleutherAI harness (Gao et al., 2021) (Version 1).\n\n### Discussion\n\nComparing each Backpack LM to a Transformer LM of equivalent specification to the Backpack's contextualization network, we see that the Backpack performs roughly as well (Table 2). Again, the Backpack has more parameters, a tax for the interface provided by sense vectors. During training, we find that Backpack language models take longer to converge than Transformers. Curiously, while the Small Backpack and Transformer achieve almost identical OWT perplexity, the Backpack language models perform substantially better on LAMBADA and Wikitext, but worse on BLiMP.\n\n### Effect of varying the number of senses\n\nTo study the impact of the number of sense vectors on language modeling performance, we train Mini-sized Backpack language models on a reduced schedule of 50,000 gradient steps, for \\(k\\in\\{1,4,16,64\\}\\) sense vectors. The perplexities for \\(k=1,4,16,64\\) are 38.6, 29.3, 26.0, and 24.1, demonstrating the necessity of a non-singleton set of sense vectors. Table 8 contains the full results.\n\n## 5 Emergent Structure in Sense Vectors\n\nBackpack language model sense vectors are not trained using a supervised notion of word sense, but implicitly specialize to encode different shades of a word's predictive use. In this section, we qualitatively examine sense vectors (Section 5.1) and quantitatively demonstrate their effectiveness in computing lexical similarity and relatedness (Section 5.2). Taken together, this suggests that sense vectors can provide a high-level interface for intervention, which we explore in Section 6.\n\n### Visualizing Senses\n\nEmpirically, trained Backpack models associate specific sense vector indices with different roles for prediction. We interpret these roles by picking a sense \\(\\ell\\) of a word \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), and projecting this sense onto the word embeddings: \\(E^{\\top}C(\\mathbf{x})_{\\ell}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}\\). Note that this is _exactly_ (up to a scalar) how this sense contributes to any prediction of the model. We interpret a sense vector's role by reporting the words with the highest score under this projection.\n\nTable 3 visualizes a few of these senses. For example, sense 12 seems to encode a broad notion of relatedness for almost all words; sense 3 encodes particulars of the bigram distribution given \\(\\mathbf{x}\\); sense 14 seems to encode both associated objects for verbs, and noun modifier dependency children for nouns. In Section 5.2 we show that sense 14 encodes a powerful notion of verb similarity.\n\n### Lexical Relationship Tests\n\nClassic lexical-relatedness and similarity tests measure the extent to which a similarity function on pairs of words correlates with human-elicitied notions of similarity. Similarity functions derived from word embeddings are evaluated by Spearman correlation between the predicted and true similarity rank-order. Early non-contextual embeddings like COALS (Rohde et al., 2005), word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) have recently been outperformed by word embeddings derived by distillation of contextual networks (Bommasani et al., 2020; Gupta and Jaggi, 2021; Chronis and Erk, 2020). We evaluate Backpack LM sense vectors on similarity datasets SimLex999 (Hill et al., 2015), SimVerb3500 (Gerz et al., 2016), and relatedness datasets RG65 (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965) and (Agirre et al., 2009).\n\nSense\\(\\ell\\) Cosine.For all \\(\\ell\\in\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}\\), we define a similarity function based only on sense \\(\\ell\\):\n\n\\[\\text{Sim}_{\\ell}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})=\\text{cossim}(C(\\mathbf{x})_ {\\ell},C(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})_{\\ell}), \\tag{13}\\]\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \\hline \\hline Model & OpenWebText PPL \\(\\downarrow\\) & LAMBADA PPL \\(\\downarrow\\) & LAMBADA ACC \\(\\uparrow\\) & Wikitext PPL \\(\\downarrow\\) & BLiMP \\(\\uparrow\\) \\\\ \\hline Backpack-Micro & **31.5** & **110** & **24.7** & **71.5** & 75.6 \\\\ Transformer-Micro & 34.4 & 201 & 21.3 & 79.5 & **77.8** \\\\ \\hline Backpack-Mini & **23.5** & **42.7** & **31.6** & **49.0** & 76.2 \\\\ Transformer-Mini & 24.5 & 58.8 & 29.7 & 52.8 & **80.4** \\\\ \\hline Backpack-Small & **20.1** & **26.5** & **37.5** & **40.9** & 76.3 \\\\ Transformer-Small & **20.2** & 32.7 & 34.9 & 42.2 & **81.9** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Language modeling performance; all models trained for 100k steps, 500K token batch size, on OWT. For PPL, lower is better; for accuracy, higher is better. Note that models are not parameter-comparable; each Backpack has a matched-size Transformer in its contextualization network.\n\nwhere cossim is cosine similarity. Intuitively, we expect that some senses may specialize to learn lexical relatedness or similarity.\n\nMinimum Sense Cosine.Because each sense encodes a different aspect of a word's meaning, we might expect that highly similar words are similar across _all_ senses. We test for this strong form of similarity using\n\n\\[\\text{Sim}_{\\text{min}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})=\\min_{\\ell}\\text{Sim}_{ \\ell}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}) \\tag{14}\\]\n\nOther methods.We evaluate embeddings from the tied softmax/embedding matrices of the much larger GPT-2-1.5B (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-J-6B (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), classic word embeddings (from Bommasani et al. (2020)) and state-of-the art specialized methods using either a single vector per word (Gupta, 2021) or many vectors (Chronis and Erk, 2020).\n\nDiscussion.Sense \\(12\\) (the \"synonym\" sense) performs well across datasets, matching or outperforming embeddings like GPT-2-1.5B and GPT-J-6B (Except GPT-J-6B on RG-65). Sense \\(14\\), the \"verb objects\" sense, performs best on just verb similarity (VerbSim3500), and the minimum similarity over senses works especially well on noun lexical similarity (SimLex999.) Our methods approach the performance of state-of-the-art methods; despite being trained for a very different task, sense vectors encode substantial lexical information (Table 4).\n\n## 6 Sense Vectors for Control\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate several proof-of-concept methods that leverage sense vectors for controlling LM behavior.\n\n### Topic-controlled generation\n\nGiven a bag-of-words target \\(b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}\\), e.g., _arts, culture_, we would like to bias generation towards sequences related to concepts related to these terms. Our algorithm proceeds in three parts. First, we sort sense vectors by log-probability assigned to \\(b\\), that is, \\(b^{\\top}(E^{\\top}C(\\mathbf{x})_{\\ell})\\).5 Second, based on the scores, we assign a re-weighting factor \\(\\delta\\) to each sense; senses with the higher scores weighted more. (See Section D for details.)

Each sense is given a label thought up by the authors, and for a few words, the target words that are highest scored by the sense vector.\n\nthe Backpack using the re-weighted sense vectors, reducing \\(\\delta\\) back to \\(1\\) as the topic is introduced. The updated backpack equation is\n\n\\[\\mathbf{o}_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{k}\\alpha_{\\ell ij}\\delta_{\\ell ij}C( \\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}, \\tag{15}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\delta_{ij\\ell}\\) is the re-weighting. Intuitively, the semantic coherence of sense vectors may imply that upweighting senses with affinity to the target bag-of-words richly upweights related words and topics. We give details as to how we perform the sense re-weighting and the annealing in Section D.\n\nEvaluation.We use the label descriptors of the topic classifier of Antypas et al. (2022), with 17 categories (_sports, arts & culture, health,..._), as the bag-of-words for control. We evaluate control accuracy as the percent of generations to which the classifier assigns the correct topic label, and overall generation quality and diversity using MAUVE scores (Pillutla et al., 2021).6\n\nFootnote 6: We concatenate generations across the 17 categories and compute MAUVE against OpenWebText validation examples.\n\nResults.We compare to Plug-and-Play Language Models (PPLM; Dathathri et al. (2019)), a considerably slower, gradient-based control method using our Small Transformer model. We generate 500 samples from each model for each topic across a range of strengths of control. We find that sense controlled generation provides at least as strong control as PPLM (Figure 2), though the MAUVE scores of the unmodified Transformer are higher than the Backpack.) Results and examples are provided in the Appendix in Tables 12, 16, 17, 18.\n\n65%.7 In Figure 3, we demonstrate the clear effect of ablating sense 10 on the most likely words in one of these contexts.8\n\nFootnote 7: Curiously, Backpacks are overall less biased to begin with (in this setting); we don\u2019t have a strong hypothesis as to why.\n\nFootnote 8: It is incidental that sense 10 encodes gender bias as opposed to another sense index; the consistency in index across words may be due to parameter sharing in \\(C\\).\n\n### Knowledge editing\n\nSense vectors show promise for use in _knowledge editing_De Cao et al. (2021)--editing a model's predictions about world knowledge. In particular, many associations with proper nouns can be localized to sense vectors in that noun. In this qualitative proof-of-concept, we edit the sense vectors of a target word \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (e.g., _MacBook_ to remove associations with a word \\(\\mathbf{x}_{r}\\) (e.g., _Apple_) and replace those associations with another word \\(\\mathbf{x}_{a}\\) (e.g., _HP_). Intuitively, this intervention ensures that whenever the contextualization weights would point to a sense vector in _MacBook_ to predict words associated with _Apple_, it now predicts words associated with _HP_.\n\nWe project each sense vector of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) to the nullspace of \\(E\\mathbf{x}_{r}\\), and then add in \\(E\\mathbf{x}_{a}\\):\n\n\\[\\tilde{C}(\\mathbf{x})_{\\ell}=C(\\mathbf{x})_{\\ell}+\\frac{C(\\mathbf{x})_{\\ell}^ {T}E\\mathbf{x}_{r}}{\\|C(\\mathbf{x}_{r})_{\\ell}\\|_{2}^{2}}\\left(\\frac{E\\mathbf{ x}_{a}}{\\phi}-E\\mathbf{x}_{r}\\right),\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\phi=\\frac{\\|E\\mathbf{x}_{a}\\|_{2}^{2}}{\\|E\\mathbf{x}_{r}\\|_{2}^{2}}\\) is a normalization term to account for the differing norms of \\(E\\mathbf{x}_{a}\\) and \\(E\\mathbf{x}_{r}\\). Intuitively, this projection modifies each sense vector in measure proportional to how much \\(\\mathbf{x}_{r}\\) was predicted by that sense. So, senses of _MacBook_ that would added mass to _Apple_ now add mass to _HP_; unrelated senses are not affected. In Table 6, we show samples providing intuition for how _MacBook_ evokes HP instead of Apple, but is otherwise semantically and syntactically maintained.\n\n## 7 Related Work\n\nRepresentation learning in NLP.Learning probabilistic models of text for use in representation learning and identifying resulting structure has a long history in NLP, from non-contextual word vectors Schutze (1992); Rohde et al.

(2020). The connections between interpretation and control are rich; much work has gone into the detection and extraction of emergent structure in networks (Hupkes et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) as well as subsequently modulating behavior (Lakretz et al., 2019; Eisape et al., 2022).\n\nGeneralized Additive Models.Generalized Additive Models (GAMs; Hastie and Tibshirani (1986)) are a function family that (1) independently transforms each input feature, (2) sums these transformations of inputs and (3) applies a non-linear link function (e.g., softmax):\n\n\\[f(\\mathbf{x}_{1:n})=\\Phi\\left(r_{1}(x_{i})+\\cdots+r_{n}(x_{n})\\right) \\tag{16}\\]\n\nTreating each word-position pair as a feature, Backpacks are not GAMs because they include a weighting \\(\\alpha\\) that depends on all features. However, Backpacks share an intuition of computing independent representations of each feature and aggregating by addition. Neural GAMs have been proposed for interpretability (Agarwal et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022; Radenovic et al., 2022; Dubey et al., 2022), though never to our knowledge in language modeling. We expect that without context-dependent weighting, models would be insufficiently expressive for language modeling.\n\n## 8 Discussion\n\nIn this section, we address a few natural questions about the expressivity and interpretability of Backpacks, highlighting the limits of our knowledge.\n\nHow do Backpacks compare to architecture X?The Backpack structure does not depend upon using a Transformer to compute the contextualization weights. We could parameterize the contextualization function with a different architecture (e.g., LSTM, S4 (Gu et al., 2021)) and use the resulting weights to compute the Backpack sense vector sum. This architecture, e.g., the Backpack-S4, could then be compared to the standard S4 architecture.\n\nAre Backpacks as expressive as Transformers?We don't know. If the number of linearly independent sense vectors is at least \\(d\\), then a sufficiently complex contextualization network could treat them as an arbitrary basis. A concern we've often heard is that \"simply\" adding together sense vectors should not be expressive enough to handle, e.g., negation. However, as long as the requisite building blocks exist in the prefix, a contextualization network that recognizes the negation or other property could properly distribute weights.\n\nAre Backpacks inherently interpretable?No, but we believe no architecture is. Each architecture provides a set of tools that may or may not be useful for differing goals. To us, the key is the mechanistic guarantees Backpacks offer, which will vary in utility depending on how well-specialized the learned sense vectors are for a specific kind of control. Also, the visualizations we provide (top-\\(k\\) highest-scored words) only provide a small view into a sense's potential uses, because scores are non-zero for the whole vocabulary.\n\nAre Backpacks as compute-efficient as Transformers?At a glance, no. Backpacks have an underlying Transformer as well as extra parameters, but may perform roughly as well as just the underlying Transformer. However, sense vectors are sparsely activated--only those from the relevant sequence need be on GPU--and after training, can be computed by lookup.\n\nWhy do sense vectors specialize?Ablations in Table 8 show that they should at least learn to be linearly independent, since linear dependence is equivalent to having having fewer sense vectors, which causes higher perplexity. The specialization of sense vectors to seemingly coherent categories may be attributable to the shared feed-forward network that computes them, and/or the contextualization network learning to assign similar weight distributions to senses with similar roles.\n\nAre sense vectors like \"word senses?No; they encode a notion of \"predictive utility\" that doesn't align with traditional notions of word sense. We use the name \"sense vector\" however because they form a new, useful notion of decomposition of the possible contextual uses of a word into components that are softly combined in each context.\n\n## 9 Conclusion\n\nNon-contextual word2vec embeddings initiated modern deep learning research in NLP, and have fascinating geometric structure. Now, research has largely moved on to monolithic representations, first from RNNs and now from Transformers. Our work suggests that we can have both rich lexical structure and interventions, and strong contextual performance, in a single model.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank Amita Kamath, Steven Cao, Xiang Lisa Li, Ian Covert, and the Stanford NLP Group community for useful discussions.

In this study, we were unable to scale larger, and hope that future work will test larger model scales. In a similar vein, we do not verify that Backpack language models perform well across multiple languages. We also do not consider, e.g., finetuning Backpacks on other tasks, or masked language modeling--there is a wide range of possible uses that remain to be verified.\n\nOne potential obstacle to the use of Backpacks that we do not study is the effect of tokenization in languages with richer morphological structure than English--will the Backpack structure be amenable to modeling those languages? This may be difficult because, intuitively, the interpretability and control of Backpacks relates to the semantics of individual tokens. Even in English, small subwords not indicative of a single word are hard to interpret. What we hope to have provided is a sufficient set of experiments to motivate the further exploration of Backpacks.\n\n## 12 Ethics\n\nThis paper describes and releases an open-domain language model trained on a largely unfiltered subsection of the (mostly English portions of the) textual internet, and describes methods for interpreting and controlling said model. Any control method that can be used to help understand and guide the generation of a model can be used to more effectively generate toxic or illegal content. Despite this, we do expect that, overall, the benefit of deeper insight into Backpack language models is a step in the right direction. In particular, explanations based on the structure of Backpacks may be able to provide insights into the mechanisms behind model behaviors, increasing transparency.\n\nThe concrete models we will release, up to and including 170M parameters, are substantially smaller and less performant at generating text than many of the publicly and commercially available language models available right now, so we do not expect there to be considerable negative repercussions from the release of the artifacts. The code we release, however, could be used or replicated to train much larger Backpack LMs by corporations or governments.\n\n## References\n\n* Agarwal et al.

Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\nLanguage Model Training Details\n\nWe use the FlashAttention codebase (Dao et al., 2022) which in turn relies on the Huggingface codebase (Wolf et al., 2020) and NumPy (Harris et al., 2020). We perform no preprocessing of OpenWebText. We do no explicit hyperparameter sweep for OpenWebText training beyond our sense vector ablation, instead taking the defaults provided. We train our models on 4 A100 (40GB) GPUs. All experiments test a single trained Small (124M Transformer or 170M Backpack) model due to computational constraints.\n\n### The feed-forward sense network.\n\nWe parameterize the feed-forward network for our sense vectors by first performing layer normalization on the input embeddings, and then a feed-forward layer with residual connection and layer norm (despite it being a function of just one word) to dimensionality \\(4d\\) and back to \\(d\\). Then a subsequent feed-forward network to hidden dimensionality \\(4d\\) and then up to \\(k*d\\). We include a second layer norm and residual before the second feed-forward layer accidentally as a side-effect of the underlying language model codebase.\n\nFor our experiments ablating \\(k\\) in Section 4.5, the second feed-forward component maps to \\(d\\) and then \\(kd\\), not \\(4d\\to kd\\).\n\n## Appendix B Extra evaluations\n\n### Timing Benchmarking\n\nTo benchmark the speed of each model, we used a single A100 GPU, running the forward pass of each model with a sequence length of 512 and a batch size of 32. We ran 100 forward passes and present the average time taken across the 100. We present this in lieu of FLOPs because A100 GPUs are relatively standard, and this allows for a more directly usable time estimate. Results are in Table 7. We find that Backpacks take roughly 1.4x as long to run as their underlying Transformers.\n\n## Appendix C Lexical Similarity Details\n\nTo handle words in the lexical similarity datasets that don't appear as single words in the tokenizer, we use one of two methods. We either average all subwords, or take the first subword. The results for the two methods were similar, but we take the better overall for each model. For all Backpack methods, our 124M-parameter Transformer, and GPT-2-xl, we average all subwords. For GPT-J (which uses the same tokenizer), we take the first subword.\n\n## Appendix D Sense Vector Control Details\n\n### Topic control details\n\nThe full results are in Table 12. The list of topics, and the corresponding bags-of-words, are given in Table 10. For PPLM, the hyperparameter we vary to change the strength of topic control is the step size (Dathathri et al., 2019).\n\nWe consider a document as matching the semantic control if the classifier assigns greater than \\(0.5\\) probability to the attempted class. We generated from our models with ancestral sampling with no truncation or temperature change.\n\nTopic control.Let \\(b\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}\\) be the many-hot vector defined by the bag of words input to the control problem. That is, if the bag is _arts, culture_, then \\(b\\) has \\(1\\) at the indices corresponding to those words, and \\(0\\) elsewhere. To determine the initial weights \\(\\delta\\) for each sense vector, we first sort all \\(|\\mathcal{V}|*k\\) sense vectors by decreasing normalized dot product with the bag of words vector:\n\n\\[s(C(\\mathbf{x}))=\\frac{b^{\\top}E^{\\top}C(\\mathbf{x})}{\\max(E^{\\top}C(\\mathbf{ x}))} \\tag{17}\\]\n\nWe then take the \\(0.95\\), \\(0.80\\), and \\(0.60\\) quantiles of these scores to determine how to weight the vectors. Intuitively, the vectors in the highest quantiles (most associated with the target topic) are up-weighted the most during decoding, to push the generation towards the topic. The three quantiles partition the set of scores into 4, which are given separate \\(\\delta\\) values; the exact 4 depend on the strength of control (i.e., different points in Figure 2.) The exact \\(\\delta\\) upweighting for each point are given in Table 11.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\hline \\hline Model & Time \\(\\downarrow\\) \\\\ \\hline Backpack-Micro & 0.093 \\\\ Transformer-Micro & **0.065** \\\\ \\hline Backpack-Mini & 0.21 \\\\ Transformer-Mini & **0.15** \\\\ \\hline Backpack-Small & 0.36 \\\\ Transformer-Small & **0.26** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 7: Timing benchmarking results on an A100, average time to compute forward pass on 32-batch size 512-sequence length input.\n\nTopic annealing.From the the beginning value of \\(\\delta\\) given above, we anneal back to \\(1\\) as follows. For each sense \\(C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}\\), we compute the total sum of non-negative log-probability assigned by the sense to the set of words generated so far, intuitively to compute whether the words already generated express the meaning intended by the sense:\n\n\\[a_{C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\max\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\\top}E^{ \\top}C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}),0\\right). \\tag{18}\\]\n\nWe then re-weight by a term dependent on the sequence index to upweight terms near to the most recently generated text:\n\n\\[b_{C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}}=\\sigma\\left(-a_{C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}}f+6 \\right)*\\left(1+j\\right)/100 \\tag{19}\\]\n\nwhere \\(j\\) is the index of the word of the sense vector in the generated text, and \\(f\\) is a scaling constant set to 7.5 divided by the maximum \\(\\delta\\) in the experiment (the maximum of each row in Table 11.)\n\nFinally, we compute the annealed \\(\\delta\\) as a soft combination, weighted by \\(b_{C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}}\\), of the maximum delta and the default of \\(1\\):\n\n\\[\\delta_{\\ell ij}=b_{C(\\mathbf{x}_{j})_{\\ell}}\\delta_{\\ell ij}+(1-a)*1. \\tag{20}\\]\n\n### Gender bias mitigation details\n\nFor the third-person singular verb _they_, we found that our sense intervention on sense 10 slightly increases the probability of _they_ relative to _he_ or _she_.\n\nThe full set of nouns and prompts we use is as follows. For role nouns, we use mechanic,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l} \\hline \\hline Topic Label & Bag-of-words \\\\ \\hline arts\\_culture & arts, culture \\\\ business\\_entrepreneurs & business, entrepreneurs \\\\ celebrity\\_pop\\_culture & celebrity, pop, culture \\\\ diaries\\_daily\\_life & diaries, daily, life \\\\ family & family \\\\ fashion\\_style & fashion, style \\\\ film\\_tv\\_video & film, tv, video \\\\ fitness\\_health & fitness, health \\\\ food\\_dining & food, dining \\\\ gaming & gaming \\\\ music & music \\\\ news\\_social\\_concern & news, social, concern \\\\ other\\_hobbies & hobbies \\\\ relationships & relationships \\\\ sports & sports \\\\ travel\\_adventure & travel, adventure \\\\ youth\\_student\\_life & youth, student, life \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 10: The topics used in our topic classifier, and the bags-of-words we use for control.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline \\hline \\# Senses & Total Params & Contextl.

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.\n\nFootnote 1: [https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/CAME](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/CAME)\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nRobust training of large language models (LLMs) often relies on adaptive gradient-based optimization methods Li et al. (2022); Kingma and Ba (2015); Zhuang et al. (2020). Through the use of cumulative second-order statistics, these methods adapt the per-parameter learning rate and demonstrate superior convergence speed during the training process of LLMs. However, the remarkable performance of adaptive methods incurs an extra cost of memory usage indeed. For example, Adam requires to preserve the first moment estimate and second raw moment estimate of each gradient in order to tune the learning rate for each parameter, which inevitably triples the memory usage concerning the optimizer states. Besides, with the growing size of the model, LLMs are becoming increasingly expensive in terms of memory, and the limitation of memory is gradually emerging as a main bottleneck for training LLMs.\n\nMany existing memory-efficient optimizers attempt to store second-order statistics with sublinear memory requirement while retaining the exceptional convergence property of adaptivity Shazeer and Stern (2018); Anil et al. (2019). Adafactor optimizer achieves remarkable memory cost reduction by applying the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm Lee and Seung (2000) to factorize the accumulator matrix for squared gradients into two rank-1 factors as shown in Figure 1, where the memory requirement for the original matrix \\(V\\) decreases from \\(O(nm)\\) to \\(O(n+m)\\). Whereas, it is observed that Adafactor suffers a performance degradation in the training of large language models universally compared with conventional adaptive gradient-based optimization methods. The reason for this phenomenon is Adafactor inevitably introduces some errors that cause instability in training deep networks due to the operation of non-negative matrix factorization.\n\nFigure 1: Visualization of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Generally, NMF reduces the memory requirements from \\(O(nm)\\) to \\(O(n+m)\\). In this paper, we focus on the special case of rank-1 factors.\n\nIn addition, in the case of large-batch training that aims to accelerate the training of deep neural networks, the memory consumption of each machine (GPU/TPU) is much higher than general batch size training, which further imposes a grave constraint on the performance of the trained model. In comparison to standard training tasks, large-batch training presents more challenges for optimizers. Empirically, when the mini-batch size increases after a certain point (e.g. 1024), the test accuracy of the converged solution decreases significantly compared with the baseline (He et al., 2021). To our knowledge, there is currently no work related to memory-efficient optimizers for large-batch training.\n\nMotivated by these challenges, we firstly study a confidence-guided strategy catered to alleviate the instability of Adafactor by calculating the confidence of the generated update at each training step. On the basis of the adaptation strategy, we propose a novel CAME optimizer that saves nearly the same memory footprint as existing memory-efficient optimizers while attaining faster convergence and superior generalization performance. To further assess the scalability of our proposed algorithm, we consider an additional challenging experiment - performing large-batch training on BERT using CAME optimizer.\n\nContributions of our paper can be summarized in the following:\n\n* Inspired by training instability of Adafactor, we explore a confidence-guided strategy centered on the existing error in the raw updates of Adafactor for parameters of large language models.\n* In light of the dedicated strategy, we propose a novel optimization algorithm, CAME, for achieving faster convergence and less performance degradation catered at memory-efficient optimization. We further investigate the effect of the proposed memory-efficient optimization algorithm in large-batch training settings.\n* We demonstrate the powerful performance of CAME with extensive NLP experiments: CAME shows faster convergence and better generalization capability than Adam in BERT pre-training task with two different batch sizes (32k and 8k); in the training of GPT-2 model and T5 model, CAME achieves fast convergence speed as Adam without degrading of performance. Notably, in the large-batch training of the BERT model, CAME obtains comparable validation accuracy with LAMB using around 15% less memory usage.\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\n**Memory Efficient Adaptive Optimization** Memory efficient optimizers maintain the benefits of standard per-parameter adaptivity while significantly reducing memory footprint. Adafactor (Shazeer and Stern, 2018) proposes to reconstruct a low-rank approximation of the exponentially smoothed accumulator at each training step that is optimal with respect to the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence. SM3 (Anil et al., 2019) divides the elements in the second-order gradient matrix into sets by the observed similarity of the elements, and each item in the generated approximation matrix is the minimum of the maximum value of each set in which it is located. The methods mentioned above behave poorly in the training of large language models and converge slowly, which raises a significant challenge for memory-efficient optimization methods.\n\n**Large Batch Training** A large-batch training scheme is preferred in distributed machine learning because of its ability to increase parallelism by enhancing large-scale cluster utilization. It has seen growing interest in recent years in large-batch training (Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2021; Huo et al., 2021). In particular, a layer-wise adaptive learning rate algorithm LARS (You et al., 2017) is proposed to scale the batch size to 32k for ResNet-50. Based on LARS, LAMB optimizer (You et al., 2019) can finish the BERT training in 76 minutes through TPU v3 Pod. Despite the success of these approaches for BERT models, the much larger batch size highly boosts the GPU usage which is prohibitively expensive and inaccessible to most researchers.\n\nMoreover, training with a large batch size incurs additional challenges (Hoffer et al., 2017; Keskar et al., 2016). Large-batch training is prone to converge to sharp local minima, since the number of interactions will decrease when the batch size is increased if the number of epochs is fixed, which causes a wide gap in generalization of the model(Keskar et al., 2016). Traditional methods seek to narrow the generalization gap by carefully tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate, momentum, and label smoothing, to narrow the generalization gap (Goyal et al., 2017; Shallue et al., 2018; You et al., 2017). Yet there have been few attempts to reduce memory usage in large-batch training, and the underlying challenge remains unclear.\n\n## 3 Method\n\nIn this section, we firstly provide a brief description of the Adafactor optimizer and discuss the errors contained in the update of Adafactor (erroneous update). We further study a confidence-guided strategy and introduce the proposed CAME in detail in light of the strategy.\n\n### An overview of Adafactor\n\nThe \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) represents the loss function that we plan to minimize, where \\(\\theta\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}\\) is the parameter of the model. \\(g_{t}\\) is the gradient at step \\(t\\), \\(\\eta\\) is the learning rate, \\(r_{t}\\) and \\(c_{t}\\) are the exponential moving average of two low-rank factors for the second moments of the gradient. \\(\\epsilon_{1}\\) is a small regularization constants and \\(u_{t}\\) is the current approximate update.\n\nIn the training of large language models, Adafactor is required to apply momentum to ensure the convergence (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and the corresponding pseudocode is illustrated in Algorithm 1. The problem setting is as follows. Assume that we aim to minimize the expected value of an objective function \\(f(\\theta)\\). At each training step, we receive the loss derived from a mini-batch of data, and calculate the gradient \\(g_{t}\\) of the function based on the previous parameters. Subsequently, we update the exponential running averages of two factors for second moments of the gradient \\(r_{t}\\) and \\(c_{t}\\), compute approximations for the second moments of the gradient \\(v_{t}\\), and adjust the generated update (\\(u_{t}\\)) when \\(RMS(u_{t})\\) surpasses a specific threshold value \\(d\\) as in:\n\n\\[\\hat{u}_{t}=\\frac{u_{t}}{\\text{max}(1,RMS(u_{t})/d)} \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(RMS(u_{t})\\) refers to the root-mean-square calculation of the components of \\(u_{t}\\). Finally, the first moment of the adjusted update \\(m_{t}\\) is utilized to update the parameter, resulting in a new iteration \\(\\theta_{t}\\). The optimization continues until the parameters converge and returns the final iteration \\(\\theta_{T}\\) as our approximate solution.\n\nAdafactor derives an effective solution for non-negative matrix factorization in the special case of rank-1 factors, which obtains the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence (Lee and Seung) between the matrix \\(V\\) and the approximated matrix \\(WH\\). The formulation of the solution is as follows, in which \\(1_{m}=(1,...,1)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) represents a column vector of \\(m\\) ones:\n\n\\[W=V1_{m},\\quad H=\\frac{1_{n}^{T}V}{1_{n}^{T}V1_{m}}. \\tag{2}\\]\n\nIt should be noted that Adafactor stores only the moving averages of these factors rather than the entire matrix \\(V\\), yielding considerable memory savings and requiring memory usage proportional to \\(O(n+m)\\) instead of \\(O(nm)\\).\n\n### Erroneous Update\n\nThe non-negative matrix factorization operation in Adafactor will inevitably incur erroneous update in the training of deep neural networks. As shown in Figure 2, Adafactor always converge slower than Adam due to the existing error in calculated updates, which further limits the application scenarios of memory-efficient optimizers.\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, two scenarios demonstrate how two types of erroneous updates are supposed to be handled in the ideal case. In Figure 3(a), the difference between the momentum of updates \\(m_{t}\\) and the current update \\(u_{t}\\) is large, illustrating that the historical experience for the update of original Adafactor contains high level of errors that will inevitably influence the stability of the training process. If we utilize the raw \\(m_{t}\\) to take an optimization step, the direction of optimization will deviate increasingly from the desired direction, which is reflected by the slow convergence and performance\n\nFigure 2: Loss landscape visualization for erroneous update of Adafactor in 1-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) (Haykin, 1994) with same training steps. Adafactor deviates from the training curve of Adam.\n\ndegradation of existing memory-efficient optimizers. By contrast, when the difference between \\(m_{t}\\) and \\(u_{t}\\) is small as shown in Figure 3(b), the momentum \\(m_{t}\\) is stable with limited errors and high confidence therefore a large optimization step is required with the updating direction close to \\(m_{t}\\).\n\nInspired by the erroneous update that is universal in existing memory-efficient optimizers, we firstly consider an efficient approach to decrease the side effect caused by insecure updating. Given \\(m_{t}\\) and \\(u_{t}\\), we take the residual between them as the instability in the preserved momentum and set generated instability as the denominator of original \\(m_{t}\\) to more adaptively take an update step. Following is the formulation of the adjusted update \\(u^{\\prime}\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the regularization constant:\n\n\\[u^{\\prime}_{t}=\\frac{m_{t}}{\\sqrt{(m_{t}-u_{t})^{2}+\\epsilon}} \\tag{3}\\]\n\nExtending further on the plain method, we propose a confidence-guided strategy that enables self-adjusted updates by taking the confidence of the raw update of Adafactor into consideration. The intuition behind the proposed strategy is to calculate the residual between the exponential moving average (EMA) of the update and the current update, which represents the deviation of the approximated update. The larger the deviation of the EMA value from the current generated update, the wider the error EMA of update contains, resulting in a lower level of confidence in the EMA of update. Obviously, we expect the optimizer to take a small update when it incorporates huge error (a large residual from the present update), while updating parameters more when the optimization process is stable (involved error of EMA is limited).\n\nSpecifically, the EMA of update \\(m_{t}\\) is directly used to take an update step in Adafactor, while in our proposed strategy, \\(m_{t}\\) is divided by \\(\\sqrt{U_{t}}\\), where \\(U_{t}\\) is the calculated instability matrix. Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{U_{t}}}\\) is the confidence in the observation: viewing \\(m_{t}\\) as the prediction of the update, if \\(m_{t}\\) deviates greatly from \\(u_{t}\\) (\\(U_{t}\\) is large), which indicates a weak confidence in \\(m_{t}\\), the optimizer performs a small optimization step; if \\(u_{t}\\) closely matches \\(m_{t}\\), we have solid confidence in \\(m_{t}\\), and correspondingly take a large optimization step.\n\n### CAME Algorithm\n\nBased on the proposed confidence-guided strategy, we develop a brand-new variant of memory\n\nFigure 3: Visualization of two scenarios where Adafactor updates have different stability.\n\nefficient optimization methods with faster convergence. Our proposed CAME optimization method successfully obtains the same rate of convergence as prevailing first-order optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) and with almost equal memory cost to available memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor). The pseudocode of CAME algorithm is specified in Algorithm 2.\n\n```\nInput: Initial parameters \\(\\theta_{0}\\), learning rate \\(\\eta\\), momentum of update \\(m_{0}=0\\), \\(r_{0}=0,c_{0}=0\\), step \\(t\\) = 0, regularization constants \\(\\epsilon_{1},\\epsilon_{2}\\), exponential moving average parameters \\(\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\beta_{3}\\), clipping threshold \\(d\\) while\\(\\theta_{t}\\) not convergedo  Compute \\(g_{t}=\\nabla f(\\theta_{t-1})\\) \\(r_{t}=\\beta_{2}r_{t-1}+(1-\\beta_{2})(g_{t}^{2}+\\epsilon_{1}1_{n}1_{m}^{T})1_{m}\\) \\(c_{t}=\\beta_{2}c_{t-1}+(1-\\beta_{2})1_{n}^{T}(g_{t}^{2}+\\epsilon_{1}1_{n}1_{m} ^{T})\\) \\(v_{t}=r_{t}c_{t}/1_{n}^{T}r_{t}\\) \\(u_{t}=g_{t}/\\sqrt{v_{t}}\\) \\(\\hat{u}_{t}=u_{t}/\\text{max}(1,RMS(u_{t})/d)\\) \\(m_{t}=\\beta_{1}m_{t-1}+(1-\\beta_{1})\\hat{u}_{t}\\) \\(U_{t}=(\\hat{u}_{t}-m_{t})^{2}\\) \\(R_{t}=\\beta_{3}R_{t-1}+(1-\\beta_{3})(U_{t}+\\epsilon_{2}1_{n}1_{m}^{T})1_{m}\\) \\(C_{t}=\\beta_{3}C_{t-1}+(1-\\beta_{3})1_{n}^{T}(U_{t}+\\epsilon_{2}1_{n}1_{m}^{T})\\) \\(S_{t}=R_{t}C_{t}/1_{n}^{T}R_{t}\\) \\(\\theta_{t}=\\theta_{t-1}-\\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{S_{t}}}m_{t}\\)  end while\n```\n\n**Algorithm 2**CAME Optimizer\n\nBy calculating \\(U_{t}\\) at each training step, we employ non-negative matrix factorization on the instability matrix \\(U_{t}\\) following (Shazeer and Stern, 2018) where the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence between \\(V\\) and \\(WH\\) is minimal. With \\(U_{t}\\) factorized into \\(R_{t}\\) and \\(C_{t}\\), it is sufficient to store only the moving averages of these factors rather than the full matrix \\(U_{t}\\), thus saving considerable memory footprint.\n\nWe simply validate intuitions and the corresponding example is shown in Figure 4, in which the proposed CAME reaches the optimal point much faster than Adafactor. Learning rate is \\(10^{-3}\\) for all optimizers. In the example, we set the parameters of CAME to be the same as the default in Adafactor, \\(\\beta_{1}=0.9,\\beta_{2}=0.999\\) and set extra \\(\\beta_{3}=0.9999\\) for CAME.\n\n## 4 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we present extensive comparisons with existing optimizers on training tasks of three important large language models: BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2018a) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2022).\n\n### Setup\n\n**Dataset** We perform experiments on the BookCorpus (Radford et al., 2018a) and English Wikipedia with 800M and 2.5B words respectively. Furthermore, we focus on the GLUE benchmark (Peters et al., 2018), SQuAD v1.1 dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and SQuAD v2.0 dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) to demonstrate the performance of pre-trained BERT models with CAME optimizer.\n\n**Model** We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed CAME on three trending large language models: BERT, GPT-2 and T5. We further test the performance of CAME for large-batch training\n\nFigure 4: Loss trajectories of Adafactor and CAME. CAME reaches the target local minimum (marked as green cross in 2D plots) much faster than Adafactor.\n\nwith BERT-Large.\n\n**Compared methods** The main baselines comprise two widely-used optimizers: classic optimizer Adam and memory-efficient optimizer Adafactor. With regard to large-batch training, LAMB optimizer is additionally considered when setting baselines.\n\n**Implementation Detail** We implement our optimization algorithm in Pytorch Paszke et al. (2019). The parameters \\(\\beta_{1}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) in Algorithm 2 are set as 0.9 and 0.999 respectively, and we search for optimal \\(\\beta_{3}\\) among {0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.9999}. We use 8 Tesla V-100 GPUs and set \\(\\epsilon_{1}\\), \\(\\epsilon_{2}\\) as \\(10^{-30}\\), \\(10^{-16}\\) in all experiments with gradient accumulation and model parallelism. Besides, we set \\(\\eta\\) as \\(2\\times 10^{-4}\\), \\(6\\times 10^{-4}\\), \\(3\\times 10^{-4}\\) for BERT-Large (32K), GPT-2, T5 training and apply learning rate warmup scheduling Goyal et al. (2017) to avoid divergence due to the large learning rate, by starting with a smaller learning rate \\(\\eta\\) and gradually increasing to the large learning rate \\(\\eta\\). To make sure we are comparing with solid baselines, we use grid search to tune the hyperparameters for Adafactor, Adam and LAMB. We further improve the performance of large-batch training by applying Mixup Zhang et al. (2017) to scale the batch size up to 32,768.\n\n### BERT Training\n\nWe firstly present empirical results in the training task of BERT model to evaluate the performance of our proposed CAME optimizer, focusing on its larger variant, BERT-Large, which has 340M parameters in all. Following the default setting, we pre-train the BERT-Large model (\\(L=24,H=1024\\)) with a sequence length of 128 on 8 Tesla V-100 GPUs. The experiments were implemented with the code from NVIDIA 2 and mainly include two types of batch sizes: 8k and 32k, one of which represents the widely used setting for pre-training BERT and the other denotes the training scenario under large-batch training. The empirical results are presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6. As illustrated in Figure 5, CAME achieves a significant improvement compared with Adam and Adafactor. To be specific, CAME (\\(66.5\\%\\)) increases validation accuracy at with an increment \\(3.4\\%\\) in comparison to Adafactor (\\(63.1\\%\\)) using same number of training steps (20k). Apart from Adafactor, our proposed CAME achieves better performance than Adam in the pre-training of BERT-Large model with a huge reduction of memory cost.\n\nFootnote 2: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples)\n\nTo evaluate the performance of our proposed CAME for large-batch training, we scale the batch size for BERT-Large training to 32,768 on Wikipedia dataset. As illustrated in Figure 6, CAME consistently reaches a more remarkable improvement compared with Adafactor. We notice that the accuracy of CAME on BERT-Large pre-training is \\(68.0\\%\\), which is highly over the original Adafactor (\\(61.9\\%\\)) with same number of training steps. In addition, CAME reaches comparable accuracy with only half the training steps required for Adafactor. With batch size getting larger from 8k to 32k, CAME brings more enhancements to the training of BERT-Large in comparison with Adam and Adafactor. Compared with LAMB in large-batch training, CAME saves a high-level of\n\nFigure 5: Masked LM test accuracy of BERT-Large model trained on Wikipedia dataset with 8k batch size.\n\nFigure 6: Masked LM test accuracy of BERT-Large model trained on Wikipedia dataset with 32k batch size. CAME achieves comparable accuracy with Adafactor using around only half of required training steps (10k).\n\nmemory footprint with slight training performance degradation.\n\n**Memory Usage Comparison**  We set batch size to 1 to measure the memory usage of each optimizer more efficiently. As shown in Table 1, the two optimizers (Adam and LAMB) frequently employed for training large language models consume the highest amount of memory usage. Meanwhile, our proposed CAME optimizer exhibits a reduced memory footprint over the existing SM3 memory-efficient optimizer. As a consequence of our confidence-guided strategy in CAME, there is no doubt that CAME will introduce an increased memory footprint in comparison with Adafactor. However, the extra memory footprint incurred of CAME is almost negligible (\\(1\\%\\)) with a substantial performance improvement.\n\nFor further demonstration of the memory saving effect of CAME, we expand BERT model to BERT-4B with 4 billion weights using the scaling method of GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020). We set the mini-batch size to 64 and the accumulation steps to 16 in this experiment. In Figure 7, we train BERT-4B with three different optimizers using PyTorch framework. As a result, CAME can save 47% memory footprint about optimizer states compared with Baseline (Adam) when the weights number of a model get to 4 billion.\n\n### Downstream Tasks\n\nWe select a representative set of downstream tasks to further demonstrate the performance of BERT models pre-trained by our proposed CAME. In this part we adopt BERT-Base model for the fine-tuning task and follow the originally published BERT-Base results in Devlin et al. (2019) and Liu et al. (2019) as the main baseline. The learning rate is tuned on the dev set for each setting and each task is fine-tuned for three epochs.\n\nWe compare the end-task performance of BERT-Base with the baseline on typical downstream tasks and the empirical results are presented in Table 2. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed CAME optimizer by showing that BERT-Base model trained with CAME on two batch sizes both achieve comparable performance to the baseline with less memory cost. In particular, we observe that BERT-Base model trained with large batch (32k) presents no performance degradation and even attains higher evaluation metrics scores on some downstream tasks. Specifically, the BERT-Base model trained on CAME improves on average by 0.5 across five metrics compared to the baseline, proving the feasibility of CAME for the large-batch training task.\n\n### GPT-2 Training\n\nIn addition to BERT pre-training task, we perform CAME-based training task on another typical large language model, GPT-2. Using the original structure of GPT-2 Radford et al. (2018), we specifically adopt GPT-medium (\\(L=24,H=1024\\)) with 345M parameters in our experiment. This implementation is based on the code provided by Megatron3. Identically, we take English Wikipedia as the training dataset for this section. Unlike the pre-training of BERT in Section 4.2, we only concentrate on standard training batch size (128) for GPT-2 pre-training.\n\nFootnote 3: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM)\n\nThe empirical results of validation loss are shown in Figure 8. We are able to find that CAME achieves similar convergence and final accuracy compared to Adam, which reveals an impressive improvement over the performance of Adafactor\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c} \\hline \\hline Optimizer & Memory Cost (GB) \\\\ \\hline Adam & 8.24 \\\\ LAMB & 8.23 \\\\ Adafactor & 7.00 \\\\ SM3 & 7.44 \\\\ \\hline CAME & 7.07 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Quantitative memory usage per GPU (GB) comparison in the pre-training of BERT-Large model.\n\nFigure 7: The memory reduction about optimizer states of CAME when training BERT-4B using PyTorch.\n\nwith comparable training steps. Moreover, as indicated in Figure 9, the validation perplexity of CAME presents the same convergence performance as Adam but faster convergence speed than Adafactor, which clearly supports the validity of CAME that has fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods and low memory usage as in existing memory-efficient methods. For instance, the converged validation perplexity of CAME and Adafactor is 50.1 and 56.9 respectively, which yields a considerable improvement of 12.0%.\n\n### T5 Training\n\nFinally, we report empirical results from a different large language model training task: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer, T5. Concretely, we follow the architecture of T5 (Raffel et al., 2022) and choose T5-Base (\\(L=24,H=1024\\)) with 220M parameters for the experiment. All of our implementations are also based on the code provided by Megatron. Similarly, we consider Wikipedia with 2.5B words as the training dataset in this part. As with the training of GPT-2 in Section 4.4, we only concentrate on standard training batch size (128) for T5.\n\nThe comparison of CAME with Adafactor and Adam is conducted in the same manner as Section 4.4, and corresponding results of validation loss and validation perplexity are illustrated in Figure 10 and Figure 11 separately. Note that CAME consistently obtains comparable convergence performance for validation loss and validation perplexity on par with Adam, while reducing similar memory usage as Adafactor.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we propose a novel memory-efficient optimizer called CAME, which supports adaptive confidence-based updating guided by the residual between predicted update and generated update. CAME achieves a considerable improvement compared to existing memory-efficient optimizers in the training of large language models, with an ignorable extra memory footprint. Moreover, CAME shows comparable convergence to Adam and LAMB with huge memory reduction. In particular, CAME has proven effective for large-batch training, which serves as an advantageous extension to memory-efficient optimizers. We hope our work will provide insight into memory reduction\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Model** & **MNLI-m** & **SST-2** & **MRPC** & **SQuAD v1.1** & **SQuAD v2.0** & **Average** \\\\  & (Acc) & (Acc) & (Acc) & (F1/EM) & (F1) & - \\\\ \\hline Baseline & 84.3 & 92.8 & 88.9 & 88.5/80.8 & 76.3 & 85.4 \\\\ \\hline CAME (batch size = 8k) & 84.8 & 92.8 & 89.9 & 88.8/81.8 & 77.9 & 86.1 (**+0.7**) \\\\ CAME (batch size = 32k) & 84.5 & 92.9 & 89.8 & 88.5/81.2 & 77.4 & 85.9 (**+0.5**) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Results of fine-tuning performance on MNLI-m, SST-2, MRPC and two SQuAD datasets.

We observe, however, that the training time of CAME increases only slightly in our experiments. Beyond that, CAME exhibits minor performance degradation in large-batch training of the BERT-Large model versus LAMB, which allows for further improvement in the future. Meanwhile, it is possible to conduct further experiments on other models in other fields, such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning, thereby exploring the effectiveness of CAME training under more application scenarios. As a final point, it would be much more helpful to provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of CAME to improve comprehensiveness of the paper.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nYang You's research group is being sponsored by NUS startup grant (Presidential Young Professorship), Singapore MOE Tier-1 grant, ByteDance grant, ARCTIC grant, SMI grant and Alibaba grant.

While there is a growing number of sophisticated methods that aim to eliminate interference, our understanding of interference as a phenomenon is still limited. This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference in multilingual machine translation. Through systematic experimentation, we find that interference (or synergy) are primarily determined by model size, data size, and the proportion of each language pair within the total dataset. We observe that substantial interference occurs mainly when the model is very small with respect to the available training data, and that using standard transformer configurations with less than one billion parameters largely alleviates interference and promotes synergy. Moreover, we show that tuning the sampling temperature to control the proportion of each language pair in the data is key to balancing the amount of interference between low and high resource language pairs effectively, and can lead to superior performance overall.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nMultilingual machine translation models can benefit from transfer between different language pairs (_synergy_), but may also suffer from _interference_Ha et al. (2016); Firat et al. (2016); Aharoni et al. (2019); Arivazhagan et al. (2019). While there are methods to reduce interference and achieve better performance Wang et al. (2020); Kreutzer et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2021), such approaches are often compute intensive, and do not always work Xin et al. (2022). In this work, we demonstrate that interference in multilingual translation largely occurs when the model is very small compared to the abundance of training data, and that the simple principled approach of enlarging the model and tuning the data sampling temperature provides a consistent solution to the interference problem that can even promote synergy.\n\nThis work methodically deduces the most simple ways of reducing interference in multilingual translation. We begin by inquiring what are the dominant factors that may interfere with learning to translate a particular language pair of focus \\(s\\to t\\), in the context of learning a multilingual translation model with many different language pairs. Controlled experiments show that besides model size and number of \\(s\\to t\\) training examples, the main factor that correlates with the level of interference is the proportion of _focus pair_ examples (\\(s\\to t\\)) observed out of the _total_ number of examples (all language pairs) seen at each training step on average. Surprisingly, aspects like language similarity or number of translation directions have a much smaller effect.\n\nIn model and data scaling experiments, we observe that interference mainly occurs in extreme parameter poverty, when the language pair of focus is data-rich, but has to \"share\" a crowded parameter space with large quantities of other data. Enlarging the model to standard model sizes in machine translation literature alleviates interference and even facilitates synergy. For context, given a language pair of 15M sentence pairs that accounts for 20% of the total training data (75M), we observe severe levels of interference with 11M- and 44M-parameter transformers, but no interference when scaling the model to 176M parameters (the \"big\" model of Vaswani et al. (2017)) and significant synergy with 705M parameters. Interestingly, when the model is large enough, we find that increasing the amount of non-focus data to a certain point can further increase synergy.\n\nFinally, given the evidence that data sizes and ratios strongly correlate with interference, we experiment with a natural lever that controls the proportion of each dataset in the overall mix in the simplest way: sampling temperature. Indeed, wefind that calibrating the distribution of language pairs via temperature can substantially reduce the amount of interference in both high- and low-resource language pairs. Our results demonstrate the importance of tuning the temperature hyperparameter in multitask training, and suggest that previously reported accounts of severe interference in multilingual translation models might stem from suboptimal hyperparameter configurations.\n\n## 2 Measuring Interference\n\nWe assume a common multilingual translation setup that involves \\(L\\) language pairs \\(s\\to t\\), where the source is always the same language \\(s\\) (English), and the target language \\(t\\) varies (English-to-many), or vice versa (many-to-English). The overall training data is a union of these training subsets, we note their sizes by \\(D_{s\\to t}\\). Sampling a training example \\(x\\) follows the distribution:\n\n\\[P(x\\in s\\to t)\\propto\\left(\\frac{D_{s\\to t}}{\\sum\\limits_{s^{\\prime},t^{ \\prime}}D_{s^{\\prime}\\to t^{\\prime}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}} \\tag{1}\\]\n\nWhere \\(T\\) is the temperature hyperparameter Devlin et al. (2019); Arivazhagan et al. (2019). \\(T=1\\) maintains the original data proportions, \\(0<T<1\\) starves low resource language pairs, and \\(T>1\\) increases their representation in the training distribution. We mostly focus on the English-to-many setting in which interference is more apparent.1\n\nFootnote 1: Section 4.3 also includes many-to-English experiments, where we observe higher levels of synergy.\n\nWe define interference as a negative interaction between different translation directions in a multilingual translation model. It is measured for a specific translation direction \\(s\\to t\\) by the relative difference in performance (test-set cross-entropy loss) between a bilingual model trained to translate only from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\) (\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\text{bi}}_{s\\to t}\\)) and a multilingual counterpart that is trained to translate other additional directions (\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\text{multi}}_{s\\to t}\\)):\n\n\\[\\mathcal{I}_{s\\to t}=\\frac{\\mathcal{L}^{\\text{bi}}_{s\\to t}-\\mathcal{L}^{ \\text{multi}}_{s\\to t}}{\\mathcal{L}^{\\text{bi}}_{s\\to t}} \\tag{2}\\]\n\nNegative values of \\(\\mathcal{I}_{s\\to t}\\) indicate interference, while positive values indicate synergy.\n\n## 3 Experimental Setup\n\nModelsWe train encoder-decoder Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017) models of 4 different sizes throughout our experiments. We use the original2 transformer-base and transformer-big variants, as well as a smaller and a larger versions by adjusting the width of the architecture (Table 1).\n\nFootnote 2: With pre-layer normalization and a shared embedding matrix across the encoder input, decoder input, and decoder output Press and Wolf (2017).\n\nDataWe use the multilingual benchmark introduced by Siddhant et al. (2020) based on WMT data. This benchmark includes a diverse set of 15 languages, each paired with English. The number of training examples is also diverse, ranging from 155K sentence pairs in Gujarati to 51M examples in Czech.3 Table 2 provides additional dataset statistics.\n\nFootnote 3: Note that Siddhant et al. (2020) only uses 11K pairs in Gujarati whereas we use the additional training data recommended by the WMT\u201919 shared task ([https://statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html](https://statmt.org/wmt19/translation-task.html)).\n\nTokenizationWe build a shared vocabulary of 64K BPE tokens with sentencepiece Kudo and Richardson (2018) using a sampling temperature of 5 to increase the lower resource languages' representation. We use this vocabulary for all our experiments. We also add language ID tokens to our vocabulary, which are prepended to each source and target sequence to indicate the target language Johnson et al. (2017).\n\nTrainingWe use Fairseq Ott et al. (2019) to train transformer models with the Adam optimizer Kingma and Ba (2015) for up to 100K steps, with a dropout rate of 0.1, inverse square root learning rate schedule up to a maximum of 0.004, 8K warmup steps, and a batch size of 256K tokens. We choose the best checkpoint according to the average validation loss of all language pairs.\n\n## 4 What Impacts Interference in Multilingual Translation?\n\nWe consider 5 factors that may potentially impact the performance of a given language pair \\(s\\to t\\) in the multilingual translation setting:\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \\hline\n**Size** & **Hidden** & **FFN** & **Attn Heads** & **Params** \\\\ \\hline XS & 256 & 1024 & 4 & 11M \\\\ S & 512 & 2048 & 8 & 44M \\\\ M & 1024 & 4096 & 16 & 176M \\\\ L & 2048 & 8192 & 32 & 704M \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Model sizes used in our experiments.

Proportion of \\(s\\to t\\) examples observed during training \\(P(x\\in s\\to t)\\)\n4. Total number of languages \\(L\\)\n5. Similarity between \\(s\\to t\\) and other pairs4\n\nFootnote 4: While the other factors can be exactly quantified, it is not immediately clear how to measure language similarity. In our experiments, we use a phylogenetic interpretation of language similarity within the set of languages available in our dataset.\n\nIn the experiments we describe next, we provide empirical evidence that indicate the last two factors do not actually have a significant effect on the level of interference, and can therefore be pruned away. Subsequent experiments reveal that interference is indeed a function of model size, data size, and data proportion. Most striking is the fact that, across various data settings, enlarging the model to standard sizes consistently alleviates interference and may even promote synergy.\n\n### Does Language Similarity Matter?\n\nIntuitively, data from languages that humans perceive as similar (e.g. languages that have some degree of mutual intelligibility, exhibit similar linguistic properties, or have shared vocabularies) should have a more positive effect on translation quality comparing to data from distinct languages (Lin et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). To test this, we fix a _focus_ language, and train _trilingual_ models to translate from English to two languages, the focus language and an additional _interfering_ language. We then look at interference trends as we vary the interfering language while controlling the amount of training data for each language pair.\n\nSetupWe run two sets of experiments, one with Spanish (es, 15.2M parallel sentences) as the focus language, and another with Estonian (et, 2.2M examples). For each focus language, we select one of four interfering languages; Spanish is paired with French,5 Czech, Russian, and Chinese, while Estonian is paired with Finnish,6 French, Russian, and Chinese. To control the effects of data size in the English-Spanish experiments, we randomly sample 15.2M examples from each interfering language pair, making the ratio between focus and interfering languages 1:1. Similarly, in the English-Estonian experiments, we sample 6.6M examples from each interfering language to create a data ratio of 1:3. We also conduct similar experiments when we use only 118K focus language examples, to see the trends when the focus language pair is extremely low resource.7 Table 3 provides an overview of the language similarity experiments.\n\nFootnote 5: Spanish and French are Western Romance languages.\n\nFootnote 6: Estonian and Finnish are Balto-Finnic languages.\n\nFootnote 7: 118K sentence pairs is 128th of the English-Spanish training set. It is approximately equivalent to translating 30 novels.\n\nResultsFigure 0(a) shows the interference rate for every model size when Spanish has only 118K parallel examples (left) and when using the full English-Spanish dataset (right). The variance in results somewhat correlates with language similarity when the dataset is very small, which aligns with previous work (Lin et al., 2019); French seems to help Spanish more than other languages when the model is big enough, while Chinese helps less. However, when training with the full dataset, the differences between other languages diminish for all model sizes. Concurrently, Fernandes et al. (2023) also found no significant difference for using French or Chinese as a third language combined with English-German in a very high resource\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l r r} \\hline \\hline\n**Language** & **ID** & **\\#Sentences (M)** & **Test Set** \\\\ \\hline Czech & cs & 51.769 & WMT18 \\\\ French & fr & 40.853 & WMT14 \\\\ Russian & ru & 38.492 & WMT19 \\\\ Chinese & zh & 25.987 & WMT19 \\\\ Spanish & es & 15.177 & WMT13 \\\\ Finnish & fi & 6.587 & WMT19 \\\\ German & de & 4.509 & WMT14 \\\\ Estonian & et & 2.176 & WMT18 \\\\ Latvian & lv & 0.638 & WMT17 \\\\ Lithuanian & lt & 0.631 & WMT19 \\\\ Romanian & ro & 0.610 & WMT16 \\\\ Hindi & hi & 0.306 & WMT14 \\\\ Kazakh & kk & 0.224 & WMT19 \\\\ Turkish & tr & 0.207 & WMT18 \\\\ Gujarati & gu & 0.156 & WMT19 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Languages from the WMT-based benchmark of Siddhant et al.

The most similar language to the focus language is noted with \\(\\star\\).\n\nsetting (600M examples per language pair).\n\nWe observe similar trends when Estonian is the focus language. Figure 0(b) shows that when Estonian only has 118K training examples, combining with Finnish data seems to have some positive effect. However, this effect also shrinks when using all of the English-Estonian train set (only 2.2M examples, compared to the 15.2M of English-Spanish) and a model that is not too small.8\n\nFootnote 8: See Figure 5 in Appendix A for the results of these experiments with absolute BLEU scores.\n\n### Does the Number of Languages Matter?\n\nDo we get more interference when training with one interfering language pair or fourteen? We train models with varying numbers of language pairs while controlling for the overall number of interfering examples. We find that splitting the interfering data across more language pairs has a mild positive effect, which diminishes as the amount of focus-language data and/or model parameters scales up.\n\nSetupWe train multilingual models on English-Spanish data alongside English to 1, 4, or 14 interfering languages. The interfering data always sums\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Focus** & & **Other** & \\\\\n**Language** & **\\#Examples** & **Languages** & **\\#Examples** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{es} & \\multirow{3}{*}{15.177M} & cs/fr/ru/zh & 15.177M \\\\  & & cs+fr-ru+zh & 15.177M \\\\  & & cs+fr-ru+zh & 15.177M \\\\  & & cs+fr-ru+zh & 15.177M \\\\  & & cs+..+gu (14) & 15.177M \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{et} & \\multirow{3}{*}{2.176M} & fi/fr/ru/zh & 6.587M \\\\  & & fi+fr-ru+zh & 6.587M \\\\  & & cs+..+gu (14) & 6.587M \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{et} & \\multirow{3}{*}{0.118M} & fi/fr/ru/zh & 6.587M \\\\  & & fi+fr-ru+zh & 6.587M \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & & cs+..+gu (14) & 6.587M \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Multilingual models for experiments on the impact of the number of other languages on interference. The trilingual model results are the average per focus language from Table 3.\n\nFigure 1: Interference of models trained with en-es (a) or en-et (b) as low resource languages (left) and using their full training sets (right) together with one other language. Positive values indicate synergy, i.e. the focus language (es/et) loss of a trilingual model is lower (better) compared to its bilingual model baseline. Similarly, negative values indicate interference.\n\nup to a fixed 15.2M examples budget, distributed as evenly as possible among the different languages.9 We repeat these experiments when Estonian is the focus language and the interfering example budget is 6.6M. Table 4 provides an overview of these experiments.\n\nFootnote 9: Some languages have less than 15.2M/14 (1.08M) examples. We use all of their training data, and divide the remaining budget evenly.\n\nResultsFigure 1(a) shows that more than one interfering language pair somewhat helps when English-Spanish has few training examples, but this effect largely disappears in the full training set and with larger models. We see similar trends for Estonian in Figure 1(b), even though its full training set has only 2.2M examples. This phenomenon might be related to the fact that when the data distribution is sharp (i.e. one high resource paired with one very low resource) there is not enough incentive for the model to pay attention to the focus language's identifier token, compared to when the distribution is much more uniform. This result also corroborates similar findings for pretrained multilingual models (Conneau et al., 2020), although those experiments did not control the total quantity of data as in ours.10\n\nFootnote 10: See Figure 6 in Appendix A for the results of these experiments with absolute BLEU scores.\n\n### The Impact of Model and Data Size\n\nSeeing that language similarity and the number of interfering languages have only a limited effect on interference, we design a controlled setup to measure interference as a function of the remaining three factors: model size, focus language data size, and its proportion in the total amount of data seen during training.\n\nSetupWe train models using all the available 15.2M English-Spanish examples, with an increasing example budget for interfering language pairs, ranging from \\(1/8\\) (1.9M) to 8 times (122M) the English-Spanish data, divided as evenly as possible between French, Czech, Russian, and Chinese.11 To observe trends across \\(D_{s\\to t}\\) sizes, we\n\nFigure 2: en-es (a) and en-et (b) test interference of models trained with es (a) or et (b) as low resource languages (left) and using their full train sets (right) together with increasing number of languages, sharing a fixed budget of training examples. Positive values indicate synergy, i.e the focus language (es/et) loss of a multilingual model is lower (better) comparing to its bilingual model baseline. Similarly, negative values indicate interference.\n\nrerun these experiments with a quarter (3.8M) of the English-Spanish data, while keeping the ratios with the rest of the data similar. Finally, we also conduct these experiments in the many-to-English setting.\n\nFootnote 1: The results of the experiments are shown in Table 1.\n\nResultsFigures 2(a) and 2(b) show the interference and synergy for English-Spanish using a varying number of interfering examples. For smaller models (XS and S), increasing the amount of interfering data (i.e. decreasing the proportion of focus data) exacerbates interference. However, larger models appear to benefit from significant quantities of interfering examples; for instance, when training with \\(D_{s\\to t}=\\) 3.8M, a large model (L) can gain over 10% relative loss improvement when there is 32 times more interfering data than focus data (\\(P(x\\in s\\to t)\\approx 3\\%\\)). Interestingly, we also observe that interference is sensitive to the ratio between model parameters and focus data, as the M model trained on 15.2M focus examples produces a similar curve to that of the 4-times smaller S model trained on 3.8M examples, both intersecting the synergy/interference line at the same point. Finally, Figures 2(c) and 2(d) show that when translating _into_ English, interference is much less of an issue, occurring only in the XS model when the total amount of training data significantly exceeds the model's capacity. Scaling up the model not only improves the absolute performance (Appendix A), but also introduces substantial gains from synergy. Our results align with trends observed on cross lingual transfer when scaling pretrained multilingual models to 3.5 and 10 billion parameters (Goyal et al., 2021).\n\n### Tuning Interference with Temperature\n\nIn the previous sections we demonstrated that the dominant factors impacting interference are the model size, the amount of focus language pair data \\(D_{s\\to t}\\), and the proportion of focus pair examples observed during training \\(P(x\\in s\\to t)\\). In a\n\nFigure 3: Interference of en-es (top) and es-en (bottom) models trained using the full 15.2M en-es train set (left), and a sample of 3.8M en-es (right). Positive values indicate synergy, i.e. en-es or es-en loss of a multilingual model is lower (better) comparing to its bilingual model baseline. Similarly, negative values indicate interference.\n\npractical situation where both model size and multilingual data are fixed, how can one control the level of interference? Recalling Equation 1, we observe that the proportion of focus pair examples \\(P(x\\in s\\to t)\\) is controlled via the temperature hyperparameter \\(T\\). Although previous literature has largely used a value of \\(T=5\\) following Arivazha-gan et al. (2019), our systematic experiments with different temperatures across three different data distributions and four model sizes suggest that this value can be sub-optimal and induce a substantial amount of interference, especially for model sizes that alleviate significant amounts of interference (M and L). Conversely, tuning the temperature shows that lower values (\\(T=1,2\\)) are typically able to reduce high-resource interference without harming low-resource synergy in our standard multilingual translation setting.\n\nSetupWe train models of four sizes with temperature ranging from 1 to 5 on three training distributions: (1) all available training data, (2) discarding 3 high resource languages (Czech, French and Russian), (3) discarding 4 low resource languages (Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian and Hindi). When illustrating the results, we assign languages to high and low resource according to whether their relative data proportion decreases or increases when going from \\(T=1\\) to \\(T=2\\).\n\nResultsFigure 4 shows the trade-offs between the lower and higher resource languages, as defined above. First, we can see a clear trade-off for the smaller models (XS and S) from \\(T=1\\) to \\(T=4\\) in most cases. Increasing \\(T\\) helps promote synergy for low resource languages at the cost of increasing interference for the high resource languages. However, the larger models (M and L) clearly degrade when using \\(T\\geq 3\\); in fact, values of \\(T=1\\) and \\(T=2\\) are often better for high- and low-resource language pairs than the commonly-used \\(T=5\\). These results align with recent work Xin et al. (2022) showing that tuned scalarization is key to achieving strong bilingual baselines that often outperform more complicated multitask optimization methods.12\n\nFootnote 12: See Table 5 in Appendix A for the results of these experiments with absolute BLEU scores.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\nScaling Laws in Machine TranslationPrevious work also looked at scaling trends of data and models sizes for machine translation. Gordon et al. (2021) proposed scaling laws in the data and model parameters and demonstrated their ability to predict the validation loss of bilingual translation models from Russian, Chinese, and German to English. Ghorbani et al. (2022) found scaling laws for different configurations for the encoder and decoder,\n\nFigure 4: Average interference/synergy of high (proportion declining when incrementing \\(T\\)) and low (proportion ascending when incrementing \\(T\\)) resource languages of different model sizes (colors) for different training distributions (a,b,c) using \\(T\\) values ranging from 1 to 5 (numbers on markers). Positive values indicate synergy and negative values indicate interference.\n\nindependently varying the number of layers in each of them. Bansal et al. (2022) examined different architectures and described data size scaling laws for machine translation in a large scale for English to German and English to Chinese. While all of these works focused on the bilingual setting, we unveil trends for multilingual translation, which has increased complexity. Concurrently to our work, Fernandes et al. (2023) proposed scaling laws for multilingual machine translation, focusing on trilingual models trained on English-German with English-Chinese or French\n\nMultitask Methods for Multilingual Machine TranslationMultitask methods have been proposed extensively to enhance the performance of multilingual translation models. Some utilize validation based signals to determine which language pairs should be prioritized throughout training, either with adaptive scheduling (Jean et al., 2019), gradient similarities to the validation set Wang et al. (2020), or a multi-armed bandits model (Kreutzer et al., 2021). Zhu et al. (2021) added dedicated embedding and layer adapter modules to the Transformer, and Lin et al. (2021) suggested learning a binary mask for every model parameter and every language pair, both requiring further training after the base multilingual model converges. Li and Gong (2021) used per language gradients geometry to rescale gradients of different language pair to improve performance on low resource languages. Wang et al. (2021) extended PCGrad (Yu et al., 2020) to create Gradient Vaccine, a method that attempts to deconflict different language pairs gradients by replacing them with more similar vectors in terms of cosine similarity. While the motivation for these methods is clear and intuitive, they are usually more complex and computationally expensive than the baseline. Moreover, their efficacy is often demonstrated using relatively small13 models, while modestly increasing the model size can both strengthen the bilingual baselines and reduce the interference problem significantly.\n\nFootnote 13: Transformer-base or big from Vaswani et al. (2017).\n\nCritical Takes on Multitask Optimization MethodsMultitask optimization methods were recently under scrutiny. Kurin et al. (2022) experimented with many of those for image classification and reinforcement learning problems, and found that none of them consistently outperformed a well tuned baseline with proper use of known regularization techniques. Similarly, Xin et al. (2022) showed that despite their increased complexity, no popular multitask method was superior to a sweep over scalarization weights for a baseline trilingual translation model. This work complements this line of research by examining _multilingual_ translation models and how can modest scale and calibrated temperature reduce problems associated with multitasking.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nThis work examines the dominant factors that influence interference in multilingual machine translation. Namely, the model size, the amount of parallel data for the focus language pair, and the proportion of examples from the focus language pair with respect to the total data seen during training. While specialized multitask techniques are sometimes demonstrated on small transformer models, we find that a standard baseline model of 176M parameters reduces the interference problem significantly, and further scaling up results in synergy among the different language pairs. We further demonstrate the importance of tuning the temperature at which different language pairs are sampled during training; while existing literature largely relies on high temperatures, which indeed improve low-resource performance in parameter-poor settings, larger models benefit from a more natural distribution that reflects the raw training data. These simple strategies for addressing interference call into question the necessity and perhaps even the validity of recently-proposed complex anti-interference methods and reaffirm the tried-and-true method of increasing model capacity to accommodate for higher data diversity.\n\n## 7 Limitations\n\nOne limitation of this work is the focus on English-to-many and many-to-English settings, while previous studies also went beyond English-centric translation (Freitag and Firat, 2020; Fan et al., 2022). Second, we experiment with a WMT based benchmark that has a total of 15 languages and 200M training examples, when translation models were also trained on larger datasets (Aharoni et al., 2019; Arivazhagan et al., 2019; NLLB Team et al., 2022). We leave questions about the amount of scale that will be required to effectively mitigate interference in massively (many-to-many, billions of parallel sequences) multilingual settings for future work.\n\nAdditionally, the data collected from high resource languages may be of higher quality compared to that collected from low resource languages. Further research is needed to determine the impact of low quality training data on interference and synergy. Finally, while we explore trends when scaling models width, deeper models (Ghorbani et al., 2022) might help mitigating interference even further.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis research is supported by the Yandex Initiative in Machine Learning.

We additionally provide the test BLEU scores achieved by our models. We generate using beam search with 5 beams, without length penalty. We use SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) to calculate test sets BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores.\n\nLanguage similaritiesFigure 5 shows BLEU scores of models from experiments in Section 4.1. They reflect similar trends, as the variance between different interfering languages when the focus language has only 118K examples diminish when a decent amount of training data is available.\n\nNumber of languagesFigure 6 shows BLEU scores of models from experiments in Section 4.2. They also demonstrate that low resource pairs benefit when there are more interfering languages, but this effect disapper with a decent amount of training data.\n\nFigure 5: en-es (a) and en-et (b) test BLEU scores of models trained with es or et as low resource languages and using their full train sets together with one other en-xx pair.\n\nFigure 6: en-es (a) and en-et (b) test BLEU scores of models trained with es or et as low resource languages and using their full train sets together with increasing number of languages, sharing a fixed budget of training examples.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c}\n**Size** & **Tmp** & **cs** & **fr** & **ru** & **zh** & **es** & **fi** & **de** & **et** & **lv** & **lt** & **ro** & **hi** & **kk** & **tr** & **gu** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{XS} & bi & **19.6** & **35.1** & **24.2** & **27.3** & **31.7** & **17.7** & **24.1** & **17.5** & 12.1 & 9.2 & **22.4** & 6.5 & 0.5 & 7.7 & 1.6 \\\\  & 1 & 16.7 & 31.9 & 20.5 & 20.8 & 27.4 & 12.8 & 15.7 & 10.4 & 8.0 & 6.1 & 15.6 & 4.8 & 1.0 & 4.9 & 2.5 \\\\  & 2 & 15.5 & 30.8 & 19.0 & 20.3 & 27.4 & 14.1 & 17.6 & 13.1 & 11.3 & 9.4 & 20.4 & 9.1 & 2.3 & 9.1 & 6.4 \\\\  & 3 & 15.2 & 30.2 & 18.6 & 19.6 & 27.3 & 14.6 & 18.0 & 13.5 & 11.9 & 9.8 & 21.5 & 11.0 & 3.2 & 10.2 & 7.6 \\\\  & 4 & 14.8 & 30.1 & 18.2 & 19.4 & 27.1 & 14.7 & 18.1 & 13.7 & 12.4 & 10.0 & 21.5 & 11.7 & 3.2 & 10.7 & 8.7 \\\\  & 5 & 14.5 & 29.9 & 17.6 & 19.0 & 27.1 & 14.6 & 18.1 & 13.6 & **12.6** & **10.3** & 21.7 & **11.9** & **3.5** & **10.8** & **9.2** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{S} & bi & **22.1** & **38.4** & **27.2** & **29.9** & **33.8** & **19.8** & **26.1** & 17.4 & 12.0 & 8.5 & 22.1 & 4.8 & 0.5 & 7.2 & 1.8 \\\\  & 1 & 20.3 & 36.2 & 24.7 & 26.4 & 31.0 & 16.8 & 20.8 & 14.5 & 12.1 & 9.8 & 21.0 & 7.9 & 1.7 & 7.6 & 4.9 \\\\  & 2 & 19.9 & 35.7 & 24.1 & 25.7 & 31.4 & 18.5 & 22.4 & 17.3 & 14.9 & 12.2 & 24.1 & 14.1 & 4.6 & 12.1 & 11.6 \\\\  & 3 & 19.2 & 35.6 & 23.5 & 25.6 & 31.2 & 18.4 & 22.5 & 17.6 & 15.3 & 12.5 & 24.5 & 15.2 & 5.6 & 12.9 & 13.1 \\\\  & 4 & 19.1 & 35.2 & 23.7 & 25.0 & 30.9 & 17.5 & 22.6 & **17.7** & **15.4** & **12.8** & **25.0** & 15.3 & 5.7 & 13.3 & 13.1 \\\\  & 5 & 18.5 & 34.8 & 23.4 & 25.1 & 30.9 & 18.1 & 22.3 & 17.5 & 15.3 & 12.5 & 24.9 & **15.4** & **5.9** & **13.8** & **13.5** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{M} & bi & **23.1** & **40.1** & **28.8** & **30.7** & **34.2** & 19.6 & 25.9 & 17.1 & 11.5 & 7.8 & 21.6 & 4.0 & 0.4 & 5.9 & 1.0 \\\\  & 1 & 22.4 & 39.6 & 27.3 & 29.8 & 33.6 & 19.1 & 24.1 & 18.0 & 14.6 & 12.0 & 23.9 & 12.4 & 3.6 & 10.7 & 8.2 \\\\  & 2 & 22.1 & 39.3 & 26.5 & 29.7 & 33.5 & 19.5 & 25.7 & 19.3 & 17.1 & 13.8 & **26.5** & **15.9** & **6.3** & 14.1 & **14.2** \\\\  & 3 & 21.8 & 38.0 & 26.1 & 29.6 & 33.4 & 20.1 & **26.1** & **20.2** & **17.4** & 13.8 & **26.5** & 15.2 & 5.8 & **14.2** & 14.1 \\\\  & 4 & 21.3 & 38.0 & 25.9 & 29.0 & 33.4 & **20.3** & 25.8 & 20.1 & 16.9 & **14.1** & **26.5** & 14.6 & 5.5 & 13.7 & 12.2 \\\\  & 5 & 21.1 & 37.7 & 26.2 & 28.6 & 32.8 & 19.9 & 25.6 & 19.4 & 16.8 & 13.9 & 26.3 & 14.6 & 5.2 & 13.8 & 12.3 \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{L} & bi & 22.9 & 40.0 & 28.5 & 30.7 & 34.4 & 18.6 & 25.8 & 16.9 & 10.8 & 8.5 & 21.4 & 3.8 & 0.4 & 5.4 & 1.3 \\\\  & 1 & **23.4** & **40.7** & **29.4** & **31.4** & 34.8 & 20.7 & 26.5 & 19.2 & 16.3 & 13.4 & 26.1 & **14.4** & 4.6 & 12.5 & 10.3 \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & 2 & 23.0 & 40.4 & 29.1 & 31.1 & 34.7 & 20.6 & **28.0** & 20.2 & **17.9** & **14.2** & **26.7** & 14.2 & **4.7** & **14.2** & 12.4 \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & 3 & 22.9 & 39.8 & 28.4 & 31.1 & **34.9** & **21.3** & 27.7 & **20.5** & 17.4 & **14.2** & 26.2 & 13.5 & 4.6 & 14.0 & 12.2 \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & 4 & 22.1 & 39.2 & 26.5 & 29.8 & 34.0 & 20.5 & 26.7 & 20.3 & 17.3 & **14.2** & 26.4 & 13.8 & **4.7** & 14.0 & 12.1 \\\\ \\cline{1-1}  & 5 & 21.9 & 38.9 & 27.5 & 30.1 & 34.1 & 21.1 & 26.7 & 20.4 & 17.2 & 13.7 & 25.8 & 13.6 & 3.8 & 13.9 & **13.0** \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: Test BLEU scores across four model sizes of bilingual baselines (bi) and multilingual models trained with temperature values \\(T\\in[1,5]\\).\n\n**ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist**\n\nA For every submission:\n\nA1.

Amongst other findings, we show that people prefer highly empathic or specific reframes, as opposed to reframes that are overly positive. Our findings provide key implications for the use of LMs to assist people in overcoming negative thoughts.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nNegative thoughts are a natural part of human cognition. However, for people experiencing mental health challenges, such thoughts are often entrenched, automatic and emotionally triggering, making it difficult to overcome them in-the-moment Beck (1976). An evidence-based, well-established therapeutic intervention to overcome negative thoughts is _Cognitive Reframing_, in which a negative thought is replaced with a more hopeful \"_reframed thought,_\" which offers an alternative perspective on one's situation Beck (1976). For example, imagine a person with a situation \"_I'm submitting a research paper to ACL 2023_\" has a thought \"_This paper is going to get rejected._\" A possible way to reframe this thought is to say \"_This paper has some chance of getting accepted due to its novel methodology and potential impact._\"\n\nPsychotherapy research suggests that for a reframed thought to be effective, it must be (a) relatable to the individual, (b) helpful in overcoming the negative thought and (c) memorable to be accessible the next time a similar thought arises Beck (1976); Burns (1980). However, understanding what characterizes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe is challenging and unknown. Professional therapists can support people in coming up with such highly effective reframed thoughts. However, barriers like clinician shortages, lack of insurance coverage and stigma commonly limit access to therapists Olfson (2016); Sickel et al. (2014). NLP-based methods that assist individuals in reframing negative thoughts, in-the-moment, may provide scaffolding that is easier to engage with and that could be made widely accessible.\n\nPrior NLP research has developed methods for a range of text reframing tasks like sentiment and empathy rewriting Reif et al. (2022); Sharma et al. (2021) and more recently, positive reframing Ziems et al. (2022). However, little is known about how to develop cognitive reframing methods that automatically generate relatable, helpful and memorable reframed thoughts.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a study of how language models can be used to reframe negative thoughts (Figure 1). We study ways in which a negative thought can be reframed, how LMs can be utilized to perform this reframing and what types of reframes are preferred by people who experience negative thoughts.\n\nFirst, in collaboration with clinical psychologists and mental health professionals, we develop a new conceptual framework for characterizing the ways in which a thought might be reframed. We synthesize the most prominent cognitive reframing processes used in therapy and define seven linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts: whether the reframe _addresses \"thinking traps\"_ (faulty or distorted patterns of thinking), whether it is _rational_, _positive_, _empathic_, _actionable_, _specific_ and _readable_. Building on prior research, we develop automated metrics to measure these attributes and establish construct validity by correlating them with judgements from mental health practitioners.\n\nNext, to develop models for the cognitive reframing task, we collect and share1 a dataset from mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students. The dataset includes 600 situations and thoughts with expert-suggested reframes as well as annotations of the proposed reframing attributes. Using this dataset, we develop a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning method (Brown et al., 2020) to _generate_ reframed thoughts and to _control_ their linguistic attributes. We show that this method achieves the highest overlap with expert-suggested reframes and the highest relatability and helpfulness ratings based on evaluation from mental health experts, when compared to popular NLP baselines.\n\nFootnote 1: Our code and datasets are available at github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing.\n\nWe investigate which reframing attributes are desirable and what constitutes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe. In collaboration (and co-authorship) with mental health experts, and after appropriate ethical review, we deploy a month-long randomized field study on Mental Health America (MHA; a popular website that shares mental health resources and tools online), with 2,067 participants with informed consent. We ask MHA visitors to describe situations and negative thoughts they are experiencing and then suggest LM-generated reframed thoughts with varying linguistic attributes. We find that highly specific and highly empathic reframing is the most preferred and highly specific and actionable reframing is considered the most helpful and memorable. However, we find that reframes that are highly positive are less preferred. These findings provide key implications for cognitive reframing of negative thoughts and for the use of Human-LM interaction in this process.\n\n## 2 Problem Definition and Goals\n\nWe work on the task of _Cognitive Reframing_. Given a situation \\(\\mathbf{S_{i}}\\) and a negative thought \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\), the task is to generate a reframed thought \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\).\n\nPsychotherapy literature (Beck, 1976) highlights three desirable outcomes for a successful reframe:\n\nFigure 1: **(a)** We consider the task of reframing negative thoughts with different, more hopeful thoughts using LMs; **(b)** Different perspectives on a situation may result in different reframes. Here, we propose a framework of seven reframing attributes (see gray box). Given a reframed thought, we control each attribute (e.g., _actionability_) to generate reframes that score higher or lower on that attribute (e.g., _more or less actionable_); **(c)** We deploy this model on Mental Health America, a large U.S. national mental health website (bit.ly/changing-thoughts) and conduct a randomized field study with 2,067 participants. We suggest LM-generated reframes to MHA visitors and assess which reframing attributes are desirable and what constitutes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe.\n\n**(a)** the reframed thought must be _relatable_ to the individual, **(b)** it must _help_ them overcome the negative thought and **(c)** it must be _memorable_ the next time a similar negative thinking pattern emerges.\n\nHere, we aim to understand what constitutes successful reframing and how language models can assist people in this process. Towards this goal, we characterize the linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts (SS3), collect a dataset of situations, thoughts and reframes (SS4), develop methods to generate reframes and to measure and control their attributes (SS5; SS6) and investigate which linguistic attributes are related to the reframing outcomes of relatability, helpfulness and memorability (SS7).\n\n## 3 Framework of Linguistic Attributes of Reframed Thoughts\n\nWe draw from clinical therapy practices and collaborate with mental health experts (some of whom are co-authors) to develop a framework of linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts. We illustrate these attributes with the following example for all reframes below - Situation: \"_I submitted a research paper and it got rejected_;\" Thought: \"_I'll never succeed as a researcher_.\"\n\n**Addressing Thinking Traps.** Negative thinking often falls into common patterns, called \"_thinking traps_.\" Also called _cognitive distortions_, these include exaggerated and biased patterns of thinking which cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately [1, 22]. Common thinking traps include: assuming what others think (\"_Mind reading_\"), thinking in extremes (\"_Allor-nothing thinking_\"), focusing on the worst-case scenario (\"_Catastrophizing_\"), trying to predict the future (\"_Fortune telling_\"), etc. See Appendix D for the full list.\n\nA reframe may or may not directly address one or more of the thought's thinking traps. A reframe like \"_I don't know what the future will bring_\" directly addresses the thinking trap \"_Fortune telling_,\" whereas a reframe like \"_I will surely become a successful researcher_\" does not address this thinking trap but rather continues to express it.\n\n**Rationality.** Another strategy to reframe a thought is to reflect on evidence for and against it and reason about what these evidence imply [1]. For example, the rejection of the paper is evidence of having the thought \"_I'll never succeed as a researcher_.\" However, the evidence against this thought could be that acceptance or rejection of one paper does not make someone a failure, which may lead to a reframe \"_Just getting one paper rejected doesn't define my failure_.\" A rational reframe is guided by such strong evidence whereas an irrational reframe is based on unrealistic assumptions.\n\n**Positivity.** A reframe of a negative thought tries to emphasize the positive perspectives of the situation but different reframes may have different levels of positivity. An overly positive reframe like \"_I'm going to win best paper awards for every paper from now on_\" exaggerates the positive perspectives, which is likely to set the person up for disappointment rather than success [1]. On the other hand, a balanced response like \"_I may or may not succeed, but I'll keep trying_\" considers both positive and negative perspectives of the situation.\n\n**Empathy.** It can be helpful to acknowledge the feelings caused by negative thoughts [1, 21]. A reframe may express empathy or self-compassion by validating how one is feeling. E.g., \"_It is okay to feel disappointed when a paper gets rejected_.\"\n\n**Actionability.** To encourage pleasant emotions, one commonly used therapeutic approach is Behavioral Activation [1, 22]. This involves engaging in behaviors or actions that may help in overcoming negative thoughts. A reframe may suggest specific actions (e.g., \"_I can take the feedback I received and use it to improve my paper_\"), may not suggest specific actions but be actionable (e.g., \"_I can use this experience to learn and grow_\") or may not be actionable at all (e.g., \"_I may or may not become a successful researcher_\").\n\n**Specificity.** A reframe may specifically address the situation and the thought (e.g., \"_One paper rejection doesn't define my failure as a researcher_\") or may be generic enough to be applicable to a wide range of negative situations and thoughts (e.g., \"_I'm going to succeed_\"). While a specific reframe may be more helpful in-the-moment, a generic reframe could be effective for recurring thoughts, which are frequently a result of the \"core\" beliefs that a person holds [1, 20].\n\n**Readability.** The linguistic reasoning capabilities of individuals may be different (e.g., across age groups or education levels) [1]. Accordingly, a reframe may either be simple or complex to read (e.g., \"_I'll do well in the future_\" vs.\n\n### \"I'm resolute in my ambition to succeed\").\n\n## 4 Data Collection\n\nTo facilitate computational methods for cognitive reframing, we collect a dataset of reframed thoughts, annotated with their linguistic attributes.\n\n### Curated Situations & Negative Thoughts\n\nWe start by curating data sources for situations and negative thoughts.\n\n**Thought Records Dataset**Burger et al. (2021).** This dataset contains hypothetical and real-world situations, thoughts and emotional processes reported by crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We manually curate 180 pairs of diverse situations with negative thoughts from this dataset.\n\n**Mental Health America (MHA).** Situations and thoughts from crowdworkers may not reflect the broad range of mental health challenges that people face in real-life. To incorporate more real-world situations and thoughts, we ran a survey on the MHA website (screening.mhanational.org). MHA visitors (who typically use the website for screening of mental illnesses) were asked to describe any negative thoughts and the associated situations they were struggling with. We manually curate 120 pairs of self-reported situations and thoughts to ensure broad coverage of relevant topics based on high diversity and manual filtering.\n\n### Annotation Task and Procedure\n\nReframing negative thoughts is a cognitively difficult process that requires practice and training, making crowdwork data collection approaches challenging. To ensure high-quality reframes and annotations, we recruit 15 current mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students with significant practical experience in cognitive reframing.2 For each (situation, thought) pair in our data source (SS4.1), we ask them to (1) write two different reframed thoughts, (2) annotate the thinking traps addressed by each reframed thought and (3) compare the two reframes and choose the one that is more rational, more positive, more actionable, more empathic, more specific and more readable. In total, we collect 600 reframed thoughts with annotations on their linguistic attributes. We share this dataset publicly at github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing.\n\nFootnote 2: For recruitment, we advertised our study through university mailing lists and newsletter of a mental health organization. Recruited experts were paid @ 37.5 USD / hr.\n\n### Ethics and Safety\n\nOur data collection and randomized field study (SS7) were designed and conducted after review of potential benefits and risks to participants in consultation and collaboration with mental health experts. Both studies were approved by the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board and informed participants about study purpose, risks and data collection. All participants were 18 or older, provided informed consent and were given access to a crisis hotline. We do not assess any clinical outcomes. See SS10 for an extended discussion of ethical and safety considerations.\n\n## 5 Method\n\nWe design automated metrics for measuring linguistic attributes (SS5.1), develop methods to generate reframed thoughts (SS5.2) and to control their attributes (SS5.3).\n\n### Measuring Reframing Attributes\n\n**Addressing Thinking Traps.** Given a situation \\(\\mathbf{S_{i}}\\), a negative thought \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\) and a reframed thought \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\), our goal is to identify the set of thinking traps addressed by the reframed thought. We approach this as a multi-label classification task, and fine-tune a GPT-3 model3 on the expert-annotated thinking trap labels collected in SS4.2.\n\nFootnote 3: We use text-davinci-003 as our GPT-3 model for all experiments in this paper.\n\n**Rationality.** Rationality is the quality of being guided by reasons Damielson et al. (2004). Here, we operationalize rationality of a reframed thought \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) as its _reasoning strength_ and ask the following two questions: (1) What might be the reasoning behind \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\)?; (2) Are the reasons sound? To understand the reasoning behind \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\), we develop an _abductive explanation_ based method Peirce (1974); Bhagavatula et al. (2020); Jung et al. (2022). For a given (\\(\\mathbf{S_{i}}\\), \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\)), we use a language model to generate (a) the most plausible explanations that _support_\\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) and (b) the most plausible explanations that _refute_ it. Moreover, to check if the explanations are sound, we recursively generate explanations behind the explanations to test their reasoning strength (Appendix E). Let \\(sup(\\cdot)\\) be a generator function that generates explanation _supporting_ a reframe and let\\(ref(\\cdot)\\) be a generator function that generates explanation _refuting_ a reframe. Then, we recursively define reasoning strength \\(RS(\\mathbf{S_{i}},\\mathbf{T_{i}},\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\) as\n\n\\[\\left(\\text{P}(\\mathbf{R_{i}}=\\text{sound}|\\mathbf{S_{i}},\\mathbf{T_{i}}) \\times\\mathbb{E}_{r\\sim sep(\\cdot)}[RS(\\mathbf{S_{i}},\\mathbf{T_{i}},r)]\\right)\\] \\[-\\left(\\text{P}(\\mathbf{R_{i}}=\\text{flawed}|\\mathbf{S_{i}}, \\mathbf{T_{i}})\\times\\mathbb{E}_{r\\sim ref(\\cdot)}[RS(\\mathbf{S_{i}},\\mathbf{T_{i}},r)]\\right)\\]\n\nTo design the explanation generator functions, \\(sup(\\cdot)\\) and \\(ref(\\cdot)\\), we leverage in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). In collaboration with mental health experts, we design 10 demonstration examples of situations, thoughts and reframed thoughts with explanations that support (\"_This reframed thought is sound because..._\") and refute (\"_This reframed thought is flawed because..._\") a particular reframe. We use these examples to prompt GPT-3. Moreover, to estimate the probabilities \\(\\text{P}(\\mathbf{R_{i}}=\\text{sound})\\) and \\(\\text{P}(\\mathbf{R_{i}}=\\text{flawed})\\), we use the token probability of generating \"_sound_\" and \"_flawed_\" respectively, given \\(\\mathbf{S_{i}},\\mathbf{T_{i}},\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) and the text \"_This reframed thought is_\" as input to GPT-3.4\n\nFootnote 4: We experimented with different alternatives for \u201c_sound_\u201d and \u201c_flawed_\u201d and observed similar results.\n\n**Positivity.** To measure the positivity of the generated reframed thought, we use a RoBERTa-based sentiment classifier fine-tuned on the TweetEval benchmark (Barbieri et al., 2020).\n\n**Empathy.** To measure empathy, we build upon the empathy classification model presented in Sharma et al. (2020). This RoBERTa-based model leverages a theoretically-grounded framework of empathy consisting of three empathy communication mechanisms (emotional reactions, interpretations and explorations) and predicts empathy levels in mental health conversations on a scale from 0 to 6. Here, we further fine-tune this model on the domain of reframed thoughts through a manually labeled dataset of 300 reframed thoughts with empathy labels (labeled by one author with expertise in empathy in mental health context).\n\n**Actionability.** To measure actionability, we hypothesize that an actionable reframe is one that either (1) _suggests a concrete action_ or (2) does not suggest a concrete action but is _easy to act upon_.\n\nWe cast action concreteness as a binary classification task: given reframe \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\), predict \\(contains\\_action(\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\in\\{0,1\\}\\). We make few-shot predictions by prompting GPT-3 with 10 examples of reframed thoughts paired with actionability ratings from SS4.2 (details in Appendix A.1).\n\nTo determine the ease with which \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) can be acted upon, we examine the next set of actions entailed by \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\). Our hypothesis is that a _diverse_ next action set may indicate ambiguity which might be less actionable, whereas a _coherent_ next action set may indicate clarity which might be more actionable. Here, we instruct GPT-3 to generate \\(k=5\\) next action candidates given a reframed thought (instruction prompting; zero-shot). We compute the next action coherence -- denoted \\(next\\_action\\_coherence(\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\) -- by embedding each of the \\(k\\) action candidates using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and computing the average pairwise cosine similarity. Higher similarity indicates greater coherence among the possible next actions. Our overall actionability measurement is defined as \\(contains\\_action(\\mathbf{R_{i}})+next\\_action\\_coherence(\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\).\n\n**Specificity.** Following prior work (Xu et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2021), we measure specificity using sentence embedding similarity between the reframed thought \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) and the concatenation of the situation \\(\\mathbf{S_{i}}\\) and the thought \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\) (using RoBERTa embeddings (Liu et al., 2019)).\n\n**Readability.** We employ the commonly used Coleman-Liau Index (CLI) metric (Coleman and Liau, 1975) which assesses readability based on the character and word structure within a sentence. The Coleman-Liau Index is calculated as \\(0.0588L-0.296S-15.8\\), where \\(L\\): average number of letters per 100 words; \\(S\\) is the average number of sentences per 100 words.\n\n### Reframe Generation\n\nIn-context learning methods can learn to generalize NLP tasks from a handful of examples (_few-shot learning_) or from hand-written instructions alone (_instruction prompting_) (Brown et al., 2020). However, through a qualitative analysis of 100 manually written situations and thoughts, we found that a simple in-context learning method with a fixed set of examples often failed to appropriately reframe situations and thoughts for which no relevant in-context examples were provided (e.g., someone with anxiety having \"_racing thoughts_\").\n\nTo appropriately reframe thoughts related to a range of situations and thoughts, we develop a retrieval-based in-context learning method (Liu et al., 2022). For each situation \\(\\mathbf{S_{i}}\\) and negative thought \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\), we retrieve \\(k\\)-similar examples from our dataset (SS4). We first encode situations and thoughts using RoBERTa embeddings. Then, we retrieve \\(k\\) examples, \\(\\{(s_{1},t_{1}),...,(s_{k},t_{k})\\}\\)from our dataset based on the top-\\(k\\) values of \\(cosine\\_sim(concat(s,t),concat(\\mathbf{S_{i}},\\mathbf{T_{i}}))\\). We choose \\(k=5\\) (Appendix A.3).\n\n### Controlling Linguistic Attributes of Generated Reframes\n\nWhile our proposed method allows us to generate a single reframe, it does not directly give us control over its linguistic attributes beyond mimicking the retrieved examples (SS3). Here, we intend to vary the linguistic attributes of the reframes.\n\nA reframed thought may or may not address a thinking trap in the original thought \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\). Here, we generate two reframes \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(tt,\\text{Y})}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(tt,\\text{N})}\\), one that addresses the thinking traps in \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\) and another that does not address it.5 We extract two separate sets of in-context examples from our dataset - those that address at least one thinking trap and those that do not (as collected in SS4). We use those examples to prompt GPT-3 to generate \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(tt,\\text{Y})}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(tt,\\text{N})}\\).\n\nFootnote 5: If a thought exhibits multiple thinking traps, we check if the reframe addresses at least one of them.\n\nMoreover, a reframed thought may have high or low rationality, positivity, empathy, actionability, specificity and readability values. For these six attributes, given a reframe \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) and a linguistic attribute \\(a\\), we generate two _additional_ reframes \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(a,\\text{H})}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(a,\\text{L})}\\), one that scores higher on attribute \\(a\\) and another that scores lower on it (e.g., higher or lower actionability). To accomplish this, recall that each (situation, thought) pair from SS4.2 is annotated with two reframes and that the reframes are compared along each linguistic attribute. For a human-annotated instance \\(j\\), let \\(\\mathbf{R_{j}}^{*(a,\\text{H})}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R_{j}}^{*(a,\\text{L})}\\) be the reframes judged to be high and low on attribute \\(a\\), respectively. To generate \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(a,\\text{H})}\\) from \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\), we prompt GPT-3 with in-context examples \\(\\{\\mathbf{R_{j}}^{*(a,\\text{L})}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{R_{j}}^{*(a,\\text{H})}\\}_{ j=1}^{k}\\), using \\(k=5\\). Similarly, to generate \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}^{(a,\\text{L})}\\) from \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\), we prompt GPT-3 with examples \\(\\{\\mathbf{R_{j}}^{*(a,\\text{H})}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{R_{j}}^{*(a,\\text{L})}\\}_{ j=1}^{k}\\).\n\n## 6 Experiments and Results\n\nWe assess the construct validity of proposed linguistic attributes (SS6.1) and evaluate the performance of the reframe generation model (SS6.2).\n\n### Construct Validity of Linguistic Attributes\n\nWe validate our proposed linguistic attribute measures by correlating them with the human judgments of mental health experts, as obtained in SS4.2. We find a strong Pearson correlation for addressing thinking traps (0.680***) and actionability (0.647***), a moderate correlation for rationality (0.448**), positivity (0.550***), empathy (0.575***) and specificity (0.427**), and a weak correlation for readability (0.331*) (Table 1).6\n\nFootnote 6: *: \\(p<0.05\\);**: \\(p<0.001\\);***: \\(p<10^{-5}\\)\n\n### Reframe Generation Performance\n\nWe use both automatic and human evaluation to assess the performance of our proposed reframe generation model as developed in SS5.2.\n\n**Experimental Setup.** We use top-\\(p\\) sampling with \\(p=0.6\\) for text generation (Holtzman et al., 2020). We split the 600 expert-annotated examples (SS4) into train and test using a 70:30 split.\n\n**Baselines.

We use BLEU [24], ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L [15] and the BERTScore [23] metrics. We find that our proposed model has an 11.2% higher BLEU score and 9.7% higher ROUGE scores than the next best-performing baselines - GPT-3 Only and Positive Reframing (Table 2).\n\n**Human Evaluation.** We assess the two key reframing outcome metrics of _relatability_ (how relatable would a reframed thought be) and _helpfulness_ (how helpful would a reframed thought be in overcoming negative thoughts). We recruit three mental health practitioners. We ask them to rate the models' outputs on test set examples based on their reliability and helpfulness on a 1 to 5 scale. We find that our proposed model achieves the highest relatability and helpfulness ratings (Table 2). Surprisingly, the Positive Reframing method showed the least helpfulness and low relatability, indicating that just reframing negative thoughts based on positivity may not be highly relatable and helpful.\n\n## 7 Randomized Field Study on a Large Mental Health Platform\n\nNext, we deploy our model on a large mental health platform (SS7.1) and study what types of reframes do people prefer (SS7.2) and what characterizes relatable, helpful and memorable reframes (SS7.3).\n\n### Model Deployment\n\nWe try to understand how our proposed cognitive reframing model may assist people who experience negative thoughts. After careful assessment of ethical and safety considerations, active collaboration with mental health experts and clinical psychologists (some of whom are co-authors) and IRB approval, we deploy our model on Mental Health America (MHA), a large mental health website that provides mental health resources and tools to millions of users (bit.ly/changing-thoughts). We conduct a month-long randomized field study with 2,067 MHA visitors as participants. After choosing to use our model and after consenting to participate, MHA visitors described their situation and the thoughts they were struggling with. Next, they were shown multiple model-generated reframed thoughts in random order, asked to select the reframed thought they find most relatable, helpful and memorable and finally evaluate the selected reframed thought based on relatability, helpfulness and memorability (See Appendix F).\n\n### What types of reframed thoughts do people prefer?\n\nTo understand which reframing attributes people prefer, we suggest multiple LM-generated reframes which vary across our attribute values. Given a situation and thought, we start by generating one reframed thought using our model. Next, we randomly select an attribute (e.g., actionability) and vary the first reframe based on it (e.g., to generate two additional reframes with higher or lower actionability) using our proposed controllable text generation method (SS5.3). Figure 2 reveals key differences between the linguistic attributes of reframes that people select and prefer:\n\nFigure 2: **Which linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts do people prefer?** For a given situation and thought from MHA visitors, we show them multiple LM-generated reframes with variance across a randomly selected attribute (e.g., low, medium and high actionability). We find that highly empathic and highly specific reframings are more preferred. On the other hand, reframes with high positivity are less preferred. N: No; Y: Yes; L: Low; M: Medium; H: High. Error bars in any figure represent 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals.\n\n**(1) Highly empathic and specific reframings are preferred more.** We find that highly empathic reframes are preferred 55.7% more frequently than reframes with lower empathy (39.7% vs. 25.5%; \\(p\\) < 10\\({}^{-5}\\)); highly specific reframes are preferred 43.1% more frequently than reframes with lower specificity (39.2% vs. 27.4%; \\(p\\) < 10\\({}^{-5}\\)). Prior work has shown the importance of empathy and less \"templated\" responses in mental health support conversations Sharma et al. (2020); Althoff et al. (2016). Here, we show that empathy and specificity of LM-generated reframes may support people in reframing negative thoughts.\n\n**(2) Overly positive reframes are preferred less.** On the other hand, reframes with high positivity are preferred 22.7% less frequently than reframes with lower positivity (29.6% vs. 38.3%; \\(p\\) < 10\\({}^{-5}\\)). This may be because adopting an overly positive reframed thought may be challenging for individuals who are already experiencing emotionally triggering negative thoughts Dember and Penwell (1980).\n\nParticipants also prefer medium-readability reframes over very simple or very complex reframes, perhaps because their language is balanced for a wider audience.\n\nHow do the linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts relate to the desired outcomes of cognitive reframing?\n\nWe assess what characterizes a reframe that is relatable, helpful and memorable. We show a _single_ model-generated reframe to the participants and ask them to rate it on a 5-point Likert scale Likert (1932) with regards to the three outcome measures (1: Strongly Disagree; 5: Strongly Agree). We do not provide participants in this experiment with a choice of multiple reframes to avoid any selection effects (SS7.2). Figure 3 offers key insights on which attributes of reframed thoughts are related to different desired outcomes:\n\n**(1) Reframes that are more rational are more relatable.** We find that reframes that have higher\n\nFigure 3: **Which linguistic attributes are associated with desired cognitive reframing outcomes?** For a given situation and thought, we show one LM-generated reframe to MHA participants and ask them to rate it on relatability, helpfulness and memorability on a 1 to 5 scale. For each linguistic attribute, we compare the first (Q1) and the fourth quartile (Q4). We find that **(a)** reframes that have higher rationality are more relatable; **(b)** reframes that address thinking traps, have higher actionability or higher specificity are more helpful; **(c)** reframes that have higher actionability or higher specificity are more memorable. *:_p_ < 0.05;**:_p_ < 0.01.\n\nrationality are 10.8% more relatable than lower rationality reframes (3.91 vs. 3.53; \\(p\\) < \\(0.05\\)). This may be because higher rationality reframes, by definition, are more likely to be based on reasons and are less likely to make unrealistic assumptions, making them easier to relate to.\n\n**(2) Reframes that address thinking traps and are more actionable and specific are more _helpful._** Reframes that address thinking traps are 6.3% more helpful than reframes that do not address them (3.39 vs. 3.19; \\(p\\) < \\(0.01\\)). Such reframes specifically challenge the cognitive biases in thinking patterns (e.g., \"_Fortune Telling_\"; Appendix D), which has shown to be more effective in dealing with negative thoughts in psychotherapy research (Beck, 1976; Burns, 1980). Moreover, we find that reframes with higher actionability are 6.6% more helpful than lower actionability reframes (3.41 vs. 3.20; \\(p\\) < \\(0.05\\)) and reframes with higher specificity are 9.6% more helpful than lower specificity reframes (3.42 vs. 3.12; \\(p\\) < \\(0.01\\)).\n\n**(3) Reframes that are more actionable and more specific are more _memorable._** We find that reframes with higher actionability are 7.9% more memorable than lower actionability reframes (3.67 vs. 3.40; \\(p\\) < \\(0.01\\)) and reframes with higher specificity are 6.3% more memorable than lower specificity reframes (3.70 vs. 3.48; \\(p\\) < \\(0.05\\)).\n\n## 8 Related Work\n\nSeveral Human-LM interaction tools for mental health assist support providers, e.g., clinicians (Tanana et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2020) or peers (Sharma et al., 2023). Our work provides insights on how Human-LM interaction may directly support people struggling with mental health challenges through cognitive reframing. Computational work on cognitive reframing has relied on small-scale crowdsourcing studies (Smith et al., 2021; Morris et al., 2015). Our work develops scalable methods for cognitive reframing and conducts a randomized field study on a large mental health platform. Prior text reframing research has developed methods for related tasks including style, sentiment, politeness and empathy transfer (Reif et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2021) as well as positive reframing (Ziems et al., 2022). Our work develops text-reframing methods for cognitive reframing and demonstrates that linguistic attributes of addressing thinking traps, rationality, actionability, specificity and readability are critical to high-quality reframes. More broadly, our work relates to the growing body of research in NLP for mental health and psychological well-being (Althoff et al., 2016; Sharma and De Choudhury, 2018; Gaur et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Miner et al., 2019; Pendse et al., 2019; Perez-Rosas et al., 2019; Pruksachatkun et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019; Jaidka et al., 2020; Saha and Sharma, 2020; Sharma et al., 2020, 2020; Wadden et al., 2021; Welch et al., 2020; Zhang and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2020; Lahnala et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022; Naseem et al., 2022; Perez-Rosas et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2022; Stewart et al., 2023).\n\n## 9 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we conducted a study of how Human-Language Model Interaction may support humans in the cognitive reframing of negative thoughts. We define a framework of seven linguistic attributes of cognitive reframing, develop automatic metrics to measure these attributes and validate their measurements with mental health experts. We collect and share a dataset of 600 situations, thoughts and reframes from mental health experts and use it to train a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning model based on GPT-3. We deploy this model on the Mental Health America website and conduct a randomized field study with 2,067 participants. We find that people struggling with negative thoughts prefer reframes that are highly empathic or specific, but do not prefer reframes that are highly positive.\n\n## 10 Ethics Statement\n\nIntervention in high-risk settings such as mental health necessitates ethical considerations related to safety, privacy and bias. There is a possibility that, in attempting to assist, AI may have the opposite effect on people struggling with mental health challenges. Here, in active collaboration and consultation with mental health professionals and clinical psychologists, we took several measures to minimize these risks.\n\n**IRB Approval.** We obtained approval from the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board for both our data collection (IRB ID STUDY00015882) as well as the randomized field study (IRB ID STUDY00016783). Our organization requires all research personnel who conduct human subjects research to complete human subjects protection training using the online CITIcourse. The graduate students conducting these studies were certified by our IRB.\n\n**Informed Consent from Participants.** We obtained informed consent from all participants in our randomized field study (Appendix H). All participants were 18 years of age and older. Participants were informed that they will be interacting with an AI-based model that automatically generates reframed thoughts and is not monitored by a human. Also, they were informed about the possibility that some of the generated content may be upsetting or disturbing.\n\n**Crisis Resources.** We made it very explicit that the model should not be used as a \"cry for help\" outlet and should not be used in cases of suicidal ideation and self-harm. Also, we provided two crisis resources - Crisis Text Line (crisistextline.org) and 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (988lifeline.org) - to our participants at the start of the study.\n\n**Safety Measures.** To minimize harmful LM-generated reframings, we filtered out any response that contained suicidal ideation or self-harm-related words or phrases. For this, we created a list of 50 regular expressions (e.g., to identify phrases like \"_feeling suicidal_\", \"_wish to die_\", \"_harm myself_\") using suicidal risk assessment lexicons such as Gaur et al. (2019). An LM-generated response that matched any of the regular expressions was filtered out and not shown to the participants. Also, participants were given an option to flag inappropriate reframing suggestions through a \"Flag inappropriate\" button (Appendix C).\n\n**Privacy.** We did not collect any privately identifiable information in our randomized field study and removed any user identifiers before conducting our data analysis. All research data was stored within a separate secure computing environment and only trained research personnel were provided access to data. The situations and thoughts collected in SS4.1 went through an anonymization process, where we manually removed any user identifiers and replaced any specific identifiable information including locations, names, etc. with their more general version, following Matthews et al. (2017).\n\n## 11 Limitations\n\nWe conducted our randomized field study on a single platform (Mental Health America) and in a single language (English). However, MHA is a particularly popular source for mental health resources with over ten million yearly visitors.\n\nIn addition, we note that a range of socio-cultural factors might influence how negative thoughts should be reframed and how LMs assisting this process should be developed. Conducting studies on specific communities, including underrepresented communities and minorities, was beyond the scope of this research. Ensuring equitable access of these tools and adapting them to various socio-cultural contexts requires further investigation.\n\nNot all cognitive reframing implementations elicit situations, but we believed it was essential for making the reframe personally relatable. In the future, when an individual uses the system for multiple situations and thoughts, it would be interesting to study how their context can be learned more effectively over time. Due to privacy concerns, we presently do not gather information to link multiple sessions. However, with appropriate ethical considerations and user consent, this approach may be beneficial.\n\nOur focus in this paper was primarily on creating an intervention that is effective in-the-moment. This was motivated by recent clinical psychology research that suggests that such single-session, in-the-moment interventions can lead to significant positive long-term mental health outcomes (Schleider et al., 2022). To integrate a partial longer-term perspective, we assessed the memorability of a reframe, which may be essential for future utility. Nevertheless, evaluating long-term outcomes is critical and forms an important future research direction. Finally, we emphasize that our study does not investigate short-term or long-term clinical outcomes.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to the mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students for data annotation, as well as the MHA visitors for participating in our field study.

Using the reframed thoughts that were annotated as high or low actionable in our collected data (SS4.2), we manually create 10 demonstration examples. If a reframed thought contains an action, we ask GPT-3 to extract the action from it. Otherwise, we ask it to generate the text \"_No Action_\". Appendix A.2 shows examples. We then use these 10 demonstrations as in-context examples, followed by the reframe \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\) which we aim to classify. If GPT-3 predicts an action for \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\), we assign \\(contains\\_action(\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\) = 1; else we assign 0.\n\nFor \\(next\\_action\\_coherence(\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\), we instruct GPT-3 to generate \\(k\\) = 5 possible next actions given a reframed thought. Given (\\(\\mathbf{S_{i}}\\), \\(\\mathbf{T_{i}}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R_{i}}\\)), let \\(\\mathbf{A_{i}}\\) = \\(a_{i1},a_{i2},...,a_{ik}\\) be the generated set of next actions. Let \\(emb(\\cdot)\\) denote RoBERTa embeddings. Then, we define \\(next\\_action\\_coherence(\\mathbf{R_{i}})\\) as the average cosine similarity between \\(emb(a_{i})\\) and \\(emb(a_{j})\\) for all \\(a_{i},a_{j}\\in\\mathbf{A_{i}}\\).\n\n### Action Generation Prompt\n\nWe use the following prompt template for extracting actions through GPT-3:\n\n**Statement**: \"My bank card could be in many different places and I want to check them first before making any conclusions\"\n\n**Proposed Action**: \"Check bank card.\"\n\n**Statement**: \"I cancelled that trip because I had to. It hurts to have done so but it was the right thing\"\n\n**Proposed Action**: None\n\nAlso, we use the following instruction prompt for generating the next set of actions through GPT-3: \"_Suggest 5 actions that the person could take based on the following statement:_\"\n\n### Hyperparameter Choices for our Proposed Retrieval-Enhanced In-Context Learning Method\n\nFor the number of examples to retrieve, we experimented with \\(k\\) = \\(1,5,10\\) and \\(20\\) and found \\(k\\) = \\(5\\) to generate the most effective reframed thoughts, based on a qualitative assessment of 100 manually written situations and thoughts.\n\n## Appendix B Reproducibility\n\nCodes and datasets created in the paper can be found at [https://github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing](https://github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing) under an academic, attribution-only license. The use of existing artifacts was consistent with their intended use. For GPT-3 based models, we will use the OpenAI library. For other deep learning models, we train and them on two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs. We use the evaluate python library (pypi.org/project/evaluate) for measuring BLEU and ROUGE scores and scipy for statistical tests.\n\n## Appendix C Flagged Reframes\n\nThere were 32 reframing suggestions out of 5,760 which were flagged (0.56%). 19 of them were generic (59%). 5 of them made incorrect assumptions about the person's situation (16%). And 8 of them may not have been relatable to the person (25%). Importantly, we did not find any flagged reframes that were harmful or unsafe, which is critical in these scenarios. In future, exploring ways to create more personalized reframes could help avoid generic, assumptive or less relatable reframes.\n\nList of Thinking Traps\n\n\\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \\hline \\hline Thinking Traps & Description & Example \\\\ \\hline All-or-Nothing Thinking & Thinking in extremes. & If it isn't perfect, I failed.

To check if the explanations themselves are well-reasoned, we recursively generate explanations for the explanations. Here, we choose a recursive tree depth of 3. Also, at every step, we generate three explanations in favour of a reframe and three explanations against it.\n\nRandomized Field-Study Interface\n\nFigure 5: Illustration of the interface used for our randomized field-study: **(a)** Participant starts by writing the negative thought they are struggling with in the moment; **(b)** We ask the participant to describe a recent situation that may have led to their thought; **(c)** An AI model identifies possible cognitive distortion(s) in the thought. Participant selects the cognitive distortions that they most relate to; **(d)** An AI model generates and suggests three different reframed thoughts that may help overcome negative thinking and the associated cognitive distortion. Participant selects the reframe they find the most relatable, helpful and memorable. Some of the instructions provided to the participants, including informed consent and evaluation, have been omitted from this illustration for brevity.\n\nData Collection Instructions\n\nFigure 6: Instructions shown during data collection with mental health experts. Continued on the next page (1/3).\n\nHere, I'm reading my boss's mind and assuming that they are upset with me. I can't figure this out unless I ask them.\n\n### Example Thought Responses\n\n**Situation:**_My boss walked past me the hallway without saying hello._\n\n**Thought:**_Why are they angry with me?_\n\n**Response 1:**_I have no way of figuring out what they might be thinking. Maybe they had a lot on her mind_\n\n**Response 2:**_They are the most wonderful person I know. They must not have noticed me._\n\n**Response 3:**_They might be mad at me, but atleast they didn't say anything._\n\nCognitive Cognitive\n\n### Content Warning\n\nThis study contains situations and thoughts including but not limited to self-harm and suicidal ideation, which may be disturbing. If you have any questions or concerns, please send us an email. Should you have a strong negative reaction to some of the content, you can reach a crisis counselor at crisis text line or by texting HOME to 741741.\n\nIf you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or wish to obtain information, ask questions or discuss any concerns about this study with someone other than the researcher(s), please contact the Human Subjects Division at xox.\n\nFigure 8: Instructions shown during data collection with mental health experts (3/3).\n\n## Appendix H Consent Form Used in the Randomized\n\nField Study on MHA\n\n## Terms of Use\n\nThis tool uses artificial intelligence to generate reframed thoughts and is part of a research study.\n\n**Purpose:** The purpose of the study is to understand how digital tools can help people recognize thinking traps and practice reframing negative thoughts.\n\n**Procedure:** You will be asked to describe a thought and a situation you are struggling with. You will then identify potential \"thinking traps\" (or cognitive distortions) in the thought and reframe it in a way that is more positive, realistic, or helpful. Finally, you will be asked to take an _optional_ demographic survey, which can be skipped as preferred. The tool is expected to take ~5 minutes to complete.\n\n**Benefits:** By using this tool, you may learn about thinking traps. You will practice identifying them and reframing negative thoughts and situations. However, there is no guarantee that the tool will help you reframe your thoughts.\n\n**Data Collection and Sharing:** We will not ask you for your name or any identifiable personal information. Usage data will be made unidentifiable to the best of our extent, will be analyzed to improve the tool, and may be shared and used for future research.\n\n**Risks:** Talking about situations and thoughts you are struggling with may be disturbing to you and may bring up negative emotional reactions. In addition, the tool uses artificial intelligence to generate reframed thoughts. Appropriate steps have been taken to avoid harmful reframes, but there is a possibility that the generated content might be upsetting to you. Also, the _optional_ demographic survey asks for information that may be sensitive and could make you feel uncomfortable (e.g., _\"What are the main things contributing to your mental health problems right now?\"_). This\n\nFigure 9: Consent form shown to the MHA visitors. Continued on the next page (1/2).\n\nto be used as a \"cry for help\" outlet. Should you have a strong negative reaction to some of the content, you can text MHA to 741741 or call or text 988.\n\n**Participation:** Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You will not receive any payment for participation. You can refuse participation or stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.\n\n**Contact Us:** If you have questions or concerns about this research, or if you think you have been harmed from being in the study, please email us at XXX. If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, you can call Human Subjects Division at XXX.\n\nBy ticking this box, you are agreeing to use this tool. You are also confirming that you are at least 18 years old. Be sure that questions about the tool have been answered and that you understand what you are being asked to do.

We phrase semantic parsing as a two-step process: we first tag each input token with a multiset of output tokens. Then we arrange the tokens into an output sequence using a new way of parameterizing and predicting permutations. We formulate predicting a permutation as solving a regularized linear program and we backpropagate through the solver. In contrast to prior work, our approach does not place a priori restrictions on possible permutations, making it very expressive. Our model outperforms pretrained seq2seq models and prior work on realistic semantic parsing tasks that require generalization to longer examples. We also outperform non-tree-based models on structural generalization on the COGS benchmark. For the first time, we show that a model without an inductive bias provided by trees achieves high accuracy on generalization to deeper recursion depth.\n\nFootnote 1: [https://github.com/namednil/multiset-perm](https://github.com/namednil/multiset-perm)\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nSequence-to-sequence models have been very successfully applied to many structural tasks in NLP such as semantic parsing. However, they have also been shown to struggle with compositional generalization Lake and Baroni (2018); Finegan-Dollak et al. (2018); Kim and Linzen (2020); Hupkes et al. (2020), i.e. the model fails on examples that contain unseen compositions or deeper recursion of phenomena that it handles correctly in isolation. For example, a model which correctly parses 'Mary knew that Jim slept' should also be able to parse sentences with deeper recursion than it has seen during training such as 'Paul said that Mary knew that Jim slept'. This sort of generalization is easy for humans but challenging for neural models.\n\nIn order for a model to generalize compositionally in semantic parsing, it has to identify reusable 'fragments' and be able to systematically combine them in novel ways. One way to make a model sensitive to fragments is to make it rely on a tree that makes the compositional structure explicit. However, this complicates the training because these trees need to be obtained or induced. This is computationally demanding or at least requires structural preprocessing informed by domain knowledge.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a two-step sequence-based approach with a structural inductive bias that does not rely on trees: the 'fragments' are multisets of output tokens that we predict for every input token in a first step. A second step then arranges the tokens we predicted in the previous step into a single sequence using a permutation model. In contrast to prior work Wang et al. (2021); Lindemann et al. (2023), there are no hard constraints on the permutations that our model can predict. We show that this enables structural generalization on tasks that go beyond the class of synchronous context-free languages.\n\nFigure 1: We model seq2seq tasks by first predicting a multiset (dashed boxes) for every input token, and then permuting the tokens to put them into order. We realize the permutation using the red edges: if there is an edge from token \\(i\\) to \\(j\\), then \\(i\\) is the predecessor of \\(j\\) in the output. Every token is visited exactly once.\n\nWe overcome two key technical challenges in this work: Firstly, we do not have supervision for the correspondence between input tokens and output tokens. Therefore, we induce the correspondence during training. Secondly, predicting permutations without restrictions is computationally challenging. For this, we develop a differentiable GPU-friendly algorithm.\n\nOn realistic semantic parsing tasks our approach outperforms previous work on generalization to longer examples than seen at training. We also outperform all other non-tree models on the structural generalization tasks in semantic parsing on COGS Kim and Linzen (2020). For the first time, we also show that a model without an inductive bias towards trees can obtain high accuracy on generalization to deeper recursion on COGS.\n\nTo summarize, our main contributions are:\n\n* a flexible seq2seq model that performs well on structural generalization in semantic parsing without assuming that input and output are related to each other via a tree structure.\n* a differentiable algorithm to parameterize and predict permutations without a priori restrictions on what permutations are possible.\n\n## 2 Overview and Motivation\n\nOur approach consists of two stages. In the **first stage** (multiset tagging), we predict a multiset \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\) of tokens for every input token \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\) from the contextualized representation of \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\). This is motivated by the observation that input tokens often systematically correspond to a fragment of the output (like _slept_ corresponding to sleep and agent and a variable in Fig. 1). Importantly, we expect this systematic relationship to be largely invariant to phrases being used in new contexts or deeper recursion. We refer to the elements of the multisets as _multiset tokens_.\n\nIn the **second stage** (permutation), we order the multiset tokens to arrive at a sequential output. Conceptually, we do this by going from left to right over the _output_ and determining which multiset token to put in every position. Consider the example in Fig. 1. For the first output position, we simply select a multiset token (\\(\\star\\) in the example). All subsequent tokens are put into position by 'jumping' from the token that was last placed into the output to a new multiset token. In Fig. 1, we jump from \\(\\star\\) to girl (shown by the outgoing red edge from \\(\\star\\)). This indicates that girl is the successor of \\(\\star\\) in the output and hence the _second_ output token. From girl we jump to one of the \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\) tokens to determine what the _third_ output token is and so on. Since we predict a permutation, we must visit every multiset token exactly once in this process.\n\nThe jumps are inspired by reordering in phrase-based machine translation Koehn et al. (2007) and methods from dependency parsing, where directly modeling bi-lexical relationships on hidden states has proven successful Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016). Note also that _any_ permutation can be represented with jumps. In contrast, prior work Wang et al. (2021); Lindemann et al. (2023) has put strong restrictions on the possible permutations that can be predicted. Our approach is more flexible and empirically it also scales better to longer inputs, which opens up new applications and datasets.\n\n**Setup.** We assume we are given a dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}=\\{(\\mathbf{x}^{1},\\mathbf{y}^{1}),\\ldots\\}\\) of input utterances \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and target sequences \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). If we had gold alignments, it would be straightforward to train our model. Since we do not have this supervision, we have to discover during training which tokens of the output \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) belong into which multiset \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\). We describe the model and the training objective of the multiset tagging in Section 3. After the model is trained, we can annotate our training set with the most likely \\(\\mathbf{z}\\), and then train the permutation model.\n\nFor predicting a permutation, we associate a score with each possible jump and search for the highest-scoring sequence of jumps. We ensure that the jumps correspond to a permutation by means of constraints, which results in a combinatorial optimization problem. The flexibility of our model and its parametrization come with the challenge that this problem is NP-hard. We approximate it with a regularized linear program which also ensures differentiability. Our permutation model and its training are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss how to solve the regularized linear program and how to backpropagate through the solution.\n\n## 3 Learning Multisets\n\nFor the multiset tagging, we need to train a model that predicts the multisets \\(\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{z}_{n}\\) of tokens by conditioning on the input. We represent a multiset \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\) as an integer-valued vector that contains for every vocabulary item \\(v\\) the multiplicity of \\(v\\) in \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\), i.e. \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}=k\\) means that input token \\(i\\) contributes \\(k\\) occurrences of output type \\(v\\). If \\(v\\) is not present in multiset \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}=0\\). For example, in Fig. 1, \\(\\mathbf{z}_{3,\\text{sleep}}=1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{z}_{2,\\text{x}_{1}}=2\\). As discussed in Section 2, we do not have supervision for \\(\\mathbf{z}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{z}_{n}\\) and treat them as latent variables. To allow for efficient exact training, we assume that all \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}\\) are independent of each other conditioned on the input:\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{z}\\mid\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{i,v}P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}\\mid\\mathbf{x}) \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) ranges over the _entire_ vocabulary.\n\n**Parametrization.** We parameterize \\(P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}\\mid\\mathbf{x})\\) as follows. We first pass the input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) through a pretrained RoBERTa encoder (Liu et al., 2019), where encoder(\\(\\mathbf{x}\\)) is the output of the final layer. We then add RoBERTa's static word embeddings from the first, non-contextualized, layer to that:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{h}_{i}=\\texttt{encoder}(\\mathbf{x})_{i}+\\texttt{embed}(\\mathbf{x}_{i}) \\tag{2}\\]\n\nWe then pass \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}\\) through a feedforward network obtaining \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{i}=\\texttt{ff}(\\mathbf{h}_{i})\\) and define a distribution over the multiplicity of \\(v\\) in the multiset \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\):\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}=k|\\mathbf{x}_{i})=\\frac{\\exp\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{i}^{ T}\\mathbf{w}^{v,k}+b^{v,k}\\right)}{\\sum_{l}\\exp\\left(\\tilde{\\mathbf{h}}_{i}^{T} \\mathbf{w}^{v,l}+b^{v,l}\\right)} \\tag{3}\\]\n\nwhere the weights \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and biases \\(b\\) are specific to \\(v\\) and the multiplicity \\(k\\). In contrast to standard sequence-to-sequence models, this softmax is not normalized over the vocabulary but over the multiplicity, and we have distinct distributions for every vocabulary item \\(v\\). Despite the independence assumptions in Eq. (1), the model can still be strong because \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}\\) takes the entire input \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) into account.\n\n**Training.** The probability of generating the overall multiset \\(\\mathbf{m}\\) as the union of all \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\) is the probability that for every vocabulary item \\(v\\), the total number of occurrences of \\(v\\) across all input positions \\(i\\) sums to \\(\\mathbf{m}_{v}\\):\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{m}|\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{v}P(\\mathbf{z}_{1,v}+\\ldots+\\mathbf{z}_{n,v}= \\mathbf{m}_{v}|\\mathbf{x})\\]\n\nThis can be computed recursively:\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{z}_{1,v}+\\ldots+\\mathbf{z}_{n,v}=\\mathbf{m}_{v}\\mid \\mathbf{x})=\\] \\[\\sum_{k}P(\\mathbf{z}_{1,v}=k|\\mathbf{x})P(\\mathbf{z}_{2,v}+\\ldots \\mathbf{z}_{n,v}=\\mathbf{m}_{v}-k|\\mathbf{x})\\]\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{y})\\) be the multiset of tokens in the gold sequence \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). We train our model with gradient ascent to maximize the marginal log-likelihood of \\(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{y})\\):\n\n\\[\\sum_{(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\log P(\\mathbf{m}(\\mathbf{y})\\mid \\mathbf{x}) \\tag{4}\\]\n\nLike Lindemann et al. (2023), we found it helpful to initialize the training of our model with high-confidence alignments from an IBM-1 model (Brown et al., 1993) (see Appendix C.3 for details).\n\n**Preparation for permutation.** The scoring function of the permutation model expects a sequence as input. There is no a priori obvious order for the elements within the individual multisets \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\). We handle this by imposing a canonical order Order\\((\\mathbf{z}_{i})\\) on the elements of \\(\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\) by sorting the multiset tokens by their id in the vocabulary. They are then concatenated to form the input \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}=\\texttt{Order}(\\mathbf{z}_{1})\\ldots\\texttt{Order}( \\mathbf{z}_{n})\\) to the permutation model.\n\n## 4 Relaxed Permutations\n\nAfter predicting a multiset for every input token and arranging the elements within each multiset to form a sequence \\(z^{\\prime}\\), we predict a permutation of \\(z^{\\prime}\\).\n\nWe represent a permutation as a matrix \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) that contains exactly one 1 in every row and column and zeros otherwise. We write \\(\\mathbf{V}_{i,j}=1\\) if position \\(i\\) in \\(z^{\\prime}\\) is mapped to position \\(j\\) in the output \\(y\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be the set of all permutation matrices.\n\nNow we formalize the parametrization of permutations as discussed in Section 2. We associate a score predicted by our neural network with each permutation \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) and search for the permutation with the highest score. The score of a permutation decomposes into a sum of scores for binary 'features' of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). We use two types of features.\n\nThe first type of feature is active if the permutation \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) maps input position \\(i\\) to output position \\(j\\) (i.e. \\(\\mathbf{V}_{ij}=1\\)). We associate this feature with the score \\(s_{i\\mapsto j}\\) and use these scores only to model what the first and the last token in the output should be. That is, \\(s_{i\\mapsto 1}\\) models the preference to map position \\(i\\) in the input to the first position in the output, and analogously \\(s_{i\\mapsto n}\\) models the preference to put \\(i\\) into the last position in the output. For all output positions \\(j\\) that are neither the first nor the last position, we simply set \\(s_{i\\mapsto j}=0\\).\n\nThe second type of feature models the jumps we introduced in Section 2. We introduce a feature that is \\(1\\) iff \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) contains a jump from \\(k\\) to \\(i\\), and associate this with a score \\(s_{k\\sim i}\\). In order for there to be a jump from \\(k\\) to \\(i\\), the permutation \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) must map input \\(i\\) to some output position \\(j\\) (\\(\\mathbf{V}_{ij}=1\\)) _and_ it must also map input position \\(k\\) to output position \\(j-1\\) (\\(\\mathbf{V}_{k,j-1}=1\\)). Hence, the product \\(\\mathbf{V}_{k,j-1}\\mathbf{V}_{ij}\\) is 1 iff there is a jump from \\(k\\) to \\(i\\) at output position \\(j\\). Based on this, the sum \\(\\sum_{j}\\mathbf{V}_{k,j-1}\\mathbf{V}_{ij}\\) equals 1 if there is _any_ output position \\(j\\) at which there is a jump from \\(k\\) to \\(i\\) and 0 otherwise. This constitutes the second type of feature.\n\nMultiplying the features with their respective scores, we want to find the highest-scoring permutation under the following overall scoring function:\n\n\\[\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\mathbf{V}\\in\\mathcal{P}}\\sum_{i,j} \\mathbf{V}_{ij}s_{i\\mapsto j}+\\] \\[\\sum_{i,k}s_{k\\sim i}\\left(\\sum_{j}\\mathbf{V}_{k,j-1}\\mathbf{V}_ {ij}\\right) \\tag{5}\\]\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{V}^{*}(s)\\) be the solution to Eq. (5) as a function of the scores. Unfortunately, \\(\\mathbf{V}^{*}(s)\\) does not have sensible derivatives because \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is discrete. This makes \\(\\mathbf{V}^{*}(s)\\) unsuitable as a neural network layer. In addition, Eq. (5) is NP-hard (see Appendix A.1).\n\nWe now formulate an optimization problem that approximates Eq. (5) and which has useful derivatives. Firstly, we relax the permutation matrix \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) to a bistochastic matrix \\(\\mathbf{U}\\), i.e. \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) has non-negative elements and every row and every column each sum to 1. Secondly, note that Eq. (5) contains quadratic terms. As we will discuss in the next section, our solver assumes a linear objective, so we replace \\(\\mathbf{V}_{k,j-1}\\mathbf{V}_{ij}\\) with an auxiliary variable \\(\\mathbf{W}_{ijk}\\). The variable \\(\\mathbf{W}_{ijk}\\) is designed to take the value \\(1\\) if and only if \\(\\mathbf{U}_{i,j}=1\\)_and_\\(\\mathbf{U}_{k,j-1}=1\\). We achieve this by coupling \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) using constraints. Then, the optimization problem becomes:\n\n\\[\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{W}} \\sum_{i,j}\\mathbf{U}_{ij}s_{i\\mapsto j}+\\sum_{i,j,k}\\mathbf{W}_{ ijk}s_{k\\sim i} \\tag{6}\\] \\[\\operatorname*{subject\\,\\,to} \\sum_{i}\\mathbf{U}_{ij}=1\\hskip 28.452756pt\\forall j\\] (6a) \\[\\sum_{j}\\mathbf{U}_{ij}=1\\hskip 28.452756pt\\forall i\\] (6b) \\[\\sum_{k}\\mathbf{W}_{ijk}=\\mathbf{U}_{ij}\\hskip 28.452756pt\\forall j >1,i\\] (6c) \\[\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{W}_{ijk}=\\mathbf{U}_{k(j-1)}\\hskip 28.452756pt \\forall j>1,k\\] (6d) \\[\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{W}\\geq 0 \\tag{6e}\\]\n\nFinally, in combination with the linear objective, the argmax operation still causes the solution \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) of Eq. (6) as a function of \\(s\\) to have no useful derivatives. This is because an infinitesimal change in \\(s\\) has no effect on the solution \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) for almost all \\(s\\).\n\nTo address this, we add an entropy regularization term \\(\\tau\\left(H(\\mathbf{U})+H(\\mathbf{W})\\right)\\) to the objective Eq. (6), where \\(H(\\mathbf{U})=-\\sum_{ij}\\mathbf{U}_{ij}(\\log\\mathbf{U}_{ij}-1)\\), and \\(\\tau>0\\) determines the strength of the regularization. The entropy regularization'smooths' the solution \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) in an analogous way to softmax being a smoothed version of argmax. The parameter \\(\\tau\\) behaves analogously to the softmax temperature: the smaller \\(\\tau\\), the sharper \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) will be. We discuss how to solve the regularized linear program in Section 5.\n\n**Predicting permutations.** At test time, we want to find the highest scoring permutation, i.e. we want to solve Eq. (5). We approximate this by using \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) instead, the solution to the entropy regularized version of Eq. (6). Despite using a low temperature \\(\\tau\\), there is no guarantee that \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) can be trivially rounded to a permutation matrix. Therefore, we solve the linear assignment problem with \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) as scores using the Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn, 1955). The linear assignment problem asks for the permutation matrix \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) that maximizes \\(\\sum_{ij}\\mathbf{V}_{ij}\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)_{ij}\\).\n\n### Parametrization\n\nWe now describe how we parameterize the scores \\(s\\) to permute the tokens into the right order. We first encode the original input utterance \\(x\\) like in Eq. (2) to obtain a hidden representation \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}\\) for input token \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\). Let \\(a\\) be the function that maps \\(a(i)\\mapsto j\\) if the token in position \\(i\\) in \\(z^{\\prime}\\) came from the multiset that was generated by token \\(\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\). For example, in Fig. 1, \\(a(6)=3\\) since sleep was predicted from input token _slept_. We then define the hidden representation \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}\\) as the concatenation of \\(\\mathbf{h}_{a(i)}\\) and an embedding of \\(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\):\n\n\\[\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}=\\left[\\mathbf{h}_{a(i)};\\texttt{embed}(z_{i}^{\\prime} )\\right] \\tag{7}\\]\n\nWe parameterize the scores for starting the output with token \\(i\\) as\n\n\\[s_{i\\mapsto 1}=\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{start}}^{T}\\text{FF}_{\\text{start}}(\\mathbf{h }_{i}^{\\prime})\\]\n\nand analogously for ending it with token \\(i\\):\n\n\\[s_{i\\mapsto n}=\\mathbf{w}_{\\text{end}}^{T}\\text{FF}_{\\text{end}}(\\mathbf{h}_{i }^{\\prime})\\]\n\nWe set \\(s_{i\\mapsto j}=0\\) for all other \\(i,j\\).\n\nWe parameterize the jump scores \\(s_{k\\sim i}\\) using Geometric Attention (Csordas et al., 2022) from \\(\\mathbf{h}_{k}^{\\prime}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}\\). Intuitively, Geometric Attention favours selecting the'matching' element \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}\\) that is closest to \\(\\mathbf{h}_{k}^{\\prime}\\) in terms of distance \\(|i-k|\\) in the string. We refer to Csordas et al. (2022) for details.\n\n### Learning Permutations\n\nWe now turn to training the permutation model. At training time, we have access to the gold output \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and a sequence \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\) from the output of the multiset tagging (see the end of Section 3). We note that whenever \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\)) contains one vocabulary item at least twice, there are multiple permutations that can be applied to \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\) to yield \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). Many of these permutations will give the right result for the wrong reasons and the permutation that is desirable for generalization is latent. For example, consider Fig. 2. The token agent is followed by the entity who performs the action, whereas theme is followed by the one affected by the action. The permutation indicated by dashed arrows generalizes poorly to a sentence like _Enma knew that James slid_ since _slid_ will introduce a theme role rather than an agent role (as the sliding is happening to James). Thus, this permutation would then lead to the incorrect output know theme Emma... slide agent James, in which Emma is affected by the knowing event and James is the one who slides something.\n\nIn order to train the permutation model in this setting, we use a method that is similar to EM for structured prediction.2 During training, the model output \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{W}^{*}(s)\\) often represents a soft permutation that does _not_ permute \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\) into \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). Our goal is to push the model output into the space of (soft) permutations that lead to \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). More formally, let \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) be the set of bistochastic matrices such that \\(\\mathbf{Q}_{i,j}=0\\) iff \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}_{i}\\neq\\mathbf{y}_{j}\\). That is, any permutation included in \\(\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) leads to the gold output \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) when applied to \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\).\n\nFootnote 2: It can also be derived as a lower bound to the marginal log-likelihood \\(\\log P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) (see Appendix A.4), and be seen as a form of posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010)\n\nFirst, we project the current prediction \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) and \\(\\mathbf{W}^{*}(s)\\) into \\(\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) using the KL divergence as a measure of distance (E-step):\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{U}},\\hat{\\mathbf{W}}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\mathbf{U}\\in \\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}),\\mathbf{W}}\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{U} \\mid\\mid\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s))+ \\tag{8}\\]\n\n\\[\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{W}\\mid\\mid\\mathbf{W}^{*}(s))\\]\n\nsubject to Eq. (6a) to Eq. (6e).\n\nSimilar to the M-step of EM, we then treat \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{U}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{W}}\\) as soft gold labels and train our model to minimize the KL divergence between labels and model:\n\n\\[\\text{KL}(\\hat{\\mathbf{U}}\\mid\\mid\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s))+\\text{KL}(\\hat{\\mathbf{W }}\\mid\\mid\\mathbf{W}^{*}(s))\\]\n\nEq. (8) can be solved in the same way as the entropy regularized version of Eq. (6) because expanding the definition of KL-divergence leads to a regularized linear program with a similar feasible region (see Appendix A.3 for details).\n\n## 5 Inference for Relaxed Permutations\n\nNow we describe how to solve the entropy regularized form of Eq. (6) and how to backpropagate through it. This section may be skipped on the first reading as it is not required to understand the experiments; we note that the resulting algorithm (Algorithm 1) is conceptually relatively simple. Before describing our method, we explain the general principle.\n\n### Bregman's Method\n\nBregman's method (Bregman, 1967) is a method for constrained convex optimization. In particular, it can be used to solve problems of the form\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}^{*}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in C_{0}\\cap C_{1}\\dots \\cap C_{n},\\mathbf{x}\\succeq\\mathbf{0}}\\mathbf{s}^{T}\\mathbf{x}+\\underbrace{\\tau H(\\mathbf{x})}_{\\text{ regularizer}} \\tag{9}\\]\n\nwhere \\(C_{0},\\dots,C_{n}\\) are linear equality constraints, \\(H(\\mathbf{x})=-\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}(\\log\\mathbf{x}_{i}-1)\\) is a form of entropy regularization, and \\(\\tau\\) determines the strength of the regularization. Note that our parameterization of permutations (Eq. (6)) has this form.\n\nBregman's method is a simple iterative process. We start with the scores \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) and then cyclically iterate over the constraints and project the current estimate \\(\\mathbf{x}^{i}\\) onto the chosen constraint until convergence:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\mathbf{x}^{0}&=\\exp\\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{\\tau}\\\\ \\mathbf{x}^{i+1}&=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in C_{i}\\text{\\,\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{\\text{ \\\\(\\arg\\min_{\\textbf{x}\\in C}\\text{KL}(\\textbf{x}\\mid\\textbf{x}^{i})\\) a KL projection. In order to apply Bregman's method, we need to be able to compute the KL projection \\(\\arg\\min_{\\textbf{x}\\in C}\\text{KL}(\\textbf{x}\\mid\\textbf{x}^{i})\\) for _all_\\(C_{0},\\ldots,C_{n}\\) in closed-form. We discuss how to do this for Eq. (6) in the next section.\n\nAs an example, consider a problem of the form Eq. (9) with a single linear constraint \\(C^{\\Delta}=\\{\\textbf{x}\\mid\\sum_{i}\\textbf{x}_{i}=1\\}\\). In this case, Bregman's method coincides with the softmax function. This is because the KL projection \\(\\textbf{x}^{*}=\\arg\\min_{\\textbf{x}\\in C^{\\Delta}}\\text{KL}(\\textbf{x}\\mid \\textbf{y})\\) for \\(\\textbf{y}>\\textbf{0}\\) has the closed-form solution \\(\\textbf{x}^{*}_{i}=\\frac{\\textbf{y}_{i}}{\\sum_{i}\\textbf{y}_{i}}\\).\n\nIf we have a closed-form expression for a KL projection (such as normalizing a vector), we can use automatic differentiation to backpropagate through it. To backpropagate through the entire solver, we apply automatic differentiation to the composition of all projection steps.\n\n### Bregman's Method for Eq. (6)\n\nIn order to apply Bregmans' method to solve the entropy regularized version of Eq. (6), we need to decompose the constraints into sets which we can efficiently project onto. We choose the following three sets here: (i), containing Eq. (6a) and Eq. (6c), and (ii), containing Eq. (6a) and Eq. (6d), and finally (iii), containing only Eq. (6b). We now need to establish what the KL projections are for our chosen sets. For (iii), the projection is simple:\n\n**Proposition 1.** (Benaamou et al. (2015), Prop. 1) For \\(\\textbf{A},\\textbf{m}>0\\), the KL projection \\(\\arg\\min_{\\textbf{U}}\\text{KL}(\\textbf{U}\\mid\\mid\\textbf{A})\\) subject to \\(\\sum_{j}\\textbf{U}_{ij}=\\textbf{m}_{i}\\) is given by \\(\\textbf{U}^{*}_{ij}=\\textbf{m}_{i}\\frac{\\textbf{A}_{ij}}{\\sum_{j^{\\prime}} \\textbf{A}_{ij^{\\prime}}}\\).\n\nLet us now turn to (i) and (ii). The constraints Eq. (6d) and Eq. (6c) are structurally essentially the same, meaning that we can project onto (ii) in basically the same manner as onto (i). We project onto (i), with the following proposition:\n\n**Proposition 2.** For \\(\\textbf{A},\\textbf{B}>\\textbf{0}\\), the KL projection\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\arg\\min_{\\textbf{U},\\textbf{W}}&\\text{KL}(\\textbf{U}\\mid \\mid\\textbf{A})+\\text{KL}(\\textbf{W}\\mid\\mid\\textbf{B})\\\\ \\text{subject to}&\\sum_{i}\\textbf{U}_{ij}=1\\quad\\forall j\\\\ &\\sum_{k}\\textbf{W}_{ijk}=\\textbf{U}_{ij}\\quad\\forall j,i\\end{array} \\tag{11}\\]\n\nis given by:\n\n\\[\\textbf{U}^{*}_{ij}=\\frac{\\textbf{T}_{ij}}{\\sum_{i^{\\prime}}\\textbf{T}_{i^{ \\prime}j}}\\]\n\n\\[\\textbf{W}^{*}_{ijk}=\\textbf{U}^{*}_{ij}\\frac{\\textbf{B}_{ijk}}{\\sum_{k^{ \\prime}}\\textbf{B}_{ijk^{\\prime}}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\textbf{T}_{ij}=\\sqrt{\\textbf{A}_{ij}\\cdot\\sum_{k}\\textbf{B}_{ijk}}\\).\n\nThe proof can be found in Appendix A.2. We present the overall algorithm in Algorithm 1, and note that it is easy to implement for GPUs. In practice, we implement all projections in log space for numerical stability.\n\n## 6 Evaluation\n\n### Doubling Task\n\nOur permutation model is very expressive and is not limited to synchronous context-free languages. This is in contrast to the formalisms that other approaches rely on (Wang et al., 2021; Lindemann et al., 2023). To evaluate if our model can structurally generalize beyond the synchronous context-free languages in practice, we consider the function \\(F=\\{(w,ww)\\mid w\\in\\Sigma^{*}\\}\\). This function is related to processing challenging natural language phenomena such as reduplication and cross-serial dependencies. We compare our model with an LSTM-based seq2seq model with attention and a Transformer in the style of Csordas et al. (2021) that uses a relative positional encoding. Since the input is a sequence of symbols rather than English, we replace RoBERTa with a bidirectional LSTM and use randomly initialized embeddings. The models are trained on inputs of lengths 5 to 10 and evaluated on longer examples. The results can be found in Fig. 3. All models get perfect or close to perfect accuracy on inputs of length 11 but accuracy quickly deteriorates for the LSTM and the Transformer. In contrast, our model extrapolates very well to longer sequences.\n\n### Cogs\n\nCOGS is a synthetic benchmark for compositional generalization introduced by Kim and Linzen(2020). Models are tested for 21 different cases of generalization, 18 of which focus on using a lexical item in new contexts (**Lex**). There are 1000 instances per generalization case. Seq2seq models struggle in particular with the _structural_ generalization tasks (Yao and Koller, 2022), and we focus on those: (i) generalization to deeper **PP** recursion than seen during training (\"Emma saw a hedgehog on a chair in the garden beside the tree...\"), (ii) deeper **CP** recursion (\"Olivia mentioned that James saw that Emma admired that the dog slept\"), and (iii) PPs modifying subjects when PPs modified only objects in the training data (**OS**).\n\nWe follow previous work and use a lexicon (Akyurek and Andreas, 2021) to map some input tokens to output tokens (see Appendix C.2 for details). We also use this mechanism to handle the variable symbols in COGS.\n\nWe report the means and standard deviations for 10 random seeds in Table 1. Our approach obtains high accuracy on CP and PP recursion but exact match accuracy is low for OS. This is in part because our model sometimes predicts semantic representations for OS that are equivalent to the gold standard but use a different order for the conjuncts. Therefore, we report accuracy that accounts for this in Table 2. In both tables, we also report the impact of using a simple copy mechanism instead of the more complex lexicon induction mechanism (-Lex). Our model outperforms all other non-tree-based models by a considerable margin.\n\n**Structural generalization without trees.** All previous methods that obtain high accuracy on recursion generalization on COGS use trees. Some approaches directly predict a tree over the input (Liu et al., 2021; Weissenhorn et al., 2022), while others use derivations from a grammar for data augmentation (Qiu et al., 2022) or decompose the input along a task-specific parse tree (Drozdov et al., 2022). Our results show that trees are not as important for compositional generalization as their success in the literature may suggest, and that weaker structural assumptions already reap some of the benefits.\n\n**Logical forms with variables.** COGS uses logical forms with variables, which were removed in conversion to variable-free formats for evaluation of some approaches (Zheng and Lapata, 2021; Qiu et al., 2022; Drozdov et al., 2022). Recently, Wu et al. (2023) have argued for keeping the variable symbols because they are important for some semantic distinctions; we keep the variables.\n\n### Atis\n\nWhile COGS is a good benchmark for compositional generalization, the data is synthetic and does not contain many phenomena that are frequent in semantic parsing on real data, such as paraphrases that map to the same logical form. ATIS (Dahl et al., 1994) is a realistic English semantic parsing dataset with executable logical forms. We follow the setup of our previous work (Lindemann et al., 2023) (L'23) and use the variable-free FunQL rep\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Model** & **OS** & **CP** & **PP** & **Lex** & **Total** \\\\ \\hline Q\u201922\\({}^{\\clubsuit}\\) & - & - & - & - & **99** \\\\ D\u201922\\({}^{\\clubsuit}\\) & - & - & - & - & **99** \\\\ LexLSTM & 0 & 0 & 1 & 96 & 82 \\\\ Dangle & 0 & 14 & 14 & 98 & 85 \\\\ Dangle\\({}^{\\diamond}\\) & 0 & 25 & 35 & **99** & 88 \\\\ T5-base\\({}^{\\diamond}\\) & 0 & 13 & 18 & **99** & 86 \\\\ \\hline Ours\\({}^{\\diamond}\\) & **9\\({}_{\\pm 13}\\)** & **79\\({}_{\\pm 11}\\)** & **85\\({}_{\\pm 14}\\)** & 97\\({}_{\\pm 2}\\) & 92\\({}_{\\pm 2}\\) \\\\ Ours\\({}^{\\diamond}\\)- Lex & 5\\({}_{\\pm 6}\\) & 71\\({}_{\\pm 26}\\) & 82\\({}_{\\pm 20}\\) & 79\\({}_{\\pm 1}\\) & 75\\({}_{\\pm 2}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Exact match accuracy on **COGS** by generalization type. \\({}^{\\diamond}\\)refers to models using pretrained transformers, and \\({}^{\\clubsuit}\\)refers to models implicitly or explicitly using trees.

For Lear (Liu et al., 2021) and the AM parser (Groschwitz et al., 2018; Weissenhorn et al., 2022), we report numbers of Weissenhorn et al. (2022).\n\nFigure 3: Accuracy by input length for doubling task.\n\nresentation Guo et al. (2020). Apart from the usual iid split, we evaluate on a length split, where a model is trained on examples with few conjuncts and has to generalize to longer logical forms with more conjuncts. For a fair comparison with previous work, we do not use the lexicon/copying. We also evaluate a version of our model without RoBERTa that uses a bidirectional LSTM and GloVe embeddings instead. This mirrors the model of L'23.\n\nTable 3 shows mean accuracy and standard deviations over 5 runs. Our model is competitive with non-pretrained models in-distribution, and outperforms all other models on the length generalization. The high standard deviation on the length split stems from an outlier run with 18% accuracy - the second worst-performing run achieved an accuracy of 44%. Even without pretraining, our model performs very well. In particular, without grammar-based decoding our model performs on par or outperforms L'23_with_ grammar-based decoding.\n\nThe runtime of the model in L'23 is dominated by the permutation model and it takes up to 12 hours to train on ATIS. Training the model presented here only takes around 2 hours for both stages.\n\n**Performance breakdown.** In order for our approach to be accurate, both the multiset tagging model and the permutation model have to be accurate. Table 4 explores which model acts as the bottleneck in terms of accuracy on ATIS and COGS. The answer depends on the dataset: for the synthetic COGS dataset, predicting the multisets correctly is easy except for OS, and the model struggles more with getting the permutation right. In contrast, for ATIS, the vast majority of errors can be attributed to the first stage.\n\n### Okapi\n\nFinally, we consider the recent Okapi Hosseini et al. (2021) semantic parsing dataset, in which an English utterance from one of three domains (Callendar, Document, Email) has to be mapped to an API request. We again follow the setup of L'23 and evaluate on their length split, where a model has to generalize to longer logical forms. In contrast to all other datasets we consider, Okapi is quite noisy because it was collected with crowd workers. This presents a realistic additional challenge on top of the challenge of structural generalization.\n\nThe results of 5 runs can be found in Table 5. Our model outperforms both BART Lewis et al. (2020) and the model of L'23. In the comparison without pretraining, our model also consistently achieves higher accuracy than the comparable model of L'23 without grammar-based decoding.\n\n## 7 Related Work\n\n**Predicting permutations.** Mena et al.

(2021) compute soft permutations as an expected value by marginalizing over the permutations representable by ITGs (Wu, 1997). This approach is exact but excludes some permutations. In particular, it excludes permutations needed for COGS.3 In addition, the algorithm they describe takes a lot of resources as it is both \\(O(n^{5})\\) in memory and compute. Devatine et al. (2022) investigate sentence reordering methods. They use bigram scores, which results in a similar computational problem to ours. However, they deal with it by restricting what permutations are possible to enable tractable dynamic programs. Eisner and Tromble (2006) propose local search methods for decoding permutations for machine translation.\n\nFootnote 3: This is mostly due to the treatment of definite descriptions, which appear clustered together at the start of the logical form.\n\nOutside of NLP, Kushinsky et al. (2019) have applied Bregman's method to the quadratic assignment problem, which Eq. (5) is a special case of. Since they solve a more general problem, using their approach for Eq. (6) would require \\(O(n^{4})\\) rather than \\(O(n^{3})\\) variables in the linear program.\n\n**Compositional generalization.** Much research on compositional generalization has focused on lexical generalization with notable success (Andreas, 2020; Akyurek and Andreas, 2021; Conklin et al., 2021; Csordas et al., 2021). Structural generalization remains more challenging for seq2seq models (Yao and Koller, 2022).\n\nZheng and Lapata (2022) modify the transformer architecture and re-encode the input and partially generated output for every decoding step to disentangle the information in the representations. Structure has also been introduced in models by means of grammars: Qiu et al. (2022) heuristically induce a quasi-synchronous grammar (QCFG, Smith and Eisner (2006)) and use it for data augmentation for a seq2seq model. Kim (2021) introduces neural QCFGs which perform well on compositional generalization tasks but are very compute-intensive. Other works directly parse into trees or graphs inspired by methods from syntactic parsing (Liu et al., 2021; Herzig and Berant, 2021; Weissenhorn et al., 2022; Jambor and Bahdanau, 2022; Petit and Corro, 2023).\n\nSeveral approaches, including ours, have decoupled the presence or absence of output tokens from their order: Wang et al. (2021) train a model end-to-end to permute the input (as discussed above) and then monotonically translate it into an output sequence. Lindemann et al. (2023) also present an end-to-end differentiable model that first applies a 'fertility step' which predicts for every word how many copies to make of its representation, and then uses the permutation method of Wang et al. (2021) to reorder the representation before translating them. Cazzaro et al. (2023) first translate the input monotonically and feed it into a second model. They use alignments from an external aligner to train the first model. The second model is a tagger or a pretrained seq2seq model and predicts the output as a permutation of its input. We compare against such a baseline for permutations in Appendix B, finding that it does not work as well as ours in the compositional generalization setups we consider.\n\n## 8 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have presented a flexible new seq2seq model for semantic parsing. Our approach consists of two steps: We first tag each input token with a multiset of output tokens. Then we arrange those tokens into a sequence using a permutation model. We introduce a new method to predict and learn permutations based on a regularized linear program that does not restrict what permutations can be learned. The model we present has a strong ability to generalize compositionally on synthetic and natural semantic parsing datasets. Our results also show that trees are not necessarily required to generalize well to deeper recursion than seen at training time.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe conditional independence assumptions are a limitation for the applicability of our multiset tagging model. For example, the independence assumptions are too strong to apply it to natural language generation tasks such as summarization. From a technical point of view, the independence assumptions are important to be able to induce the latent assignment of output tokens to multisets efficiently. Future work may design multiset tagging methods that make fewer independence assumptions.\n\nWhile our method for predicting permutations is comparatively fast and only has a memory requirement of \\(O(n^{3})\\), inference on long sequences, e.g. with more than 100 tokens, remains somewhat slow. In future work, we plan to investigate other approximate inference techniques like local search and dual decomposition.\n\nRegarding the importance of trees for compositional generalization, our model has no explicit structural inductive bias towards trees. However, we do not exclude that the pretrained RoBERTa model that we use as a component _implicitly_ captures trees or tree-like structures to a certain degree.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Bailin Wang and Jonas Groschwitz for technical discussions; we thank Hao Zheng for discussions and for providing system outputs for further analysis.

Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\n## Appendix A Math Details\n\n### NP-hardness\n\nWe show that Eq. (5) can be used to decide the Hamiltonian Path problem. Let \\(G=(V,E)\\) be a graph with nodes \\(V=\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\). A Hamiltonian path \\(P=v_{1},v_{2},\\ldots,v_{n}\\) is a path in \\(G\\) (i.e. \\((v_{i},v_{i+1})\\in E\\) for all \\(i\\)) such that each node of \\(G\\) appears exactly once. Deciding if a graph has a Hamiltonian path is NP-complete.\n\n**Reduction of Hamiltonian path to Eq. (5).** Note that a necessary but not sufficient condition for \\(P\\) to be a Hamiltonian path is that \\(P\\) is a permutation of \\(V\\). This will be ensured by the constraints on the solution in Eq. (5).\n\nWe construct a score function\n\n\\[s_{k\\sim i}=\\begin{cases}1&\\text{if }(k,i)\\in E\\\\ 0&\\text{else}\\end{cases} \\tag{12}\\]\n\nand let \\(s_{i\\mapsto j}=0\\) for all \\(i,j\\). If we find the solution of Eq. (5) for the score function Eq. (12), we obtain a permutation \\(P\\) of \\(V\\), which may or may not be a path in \\(G\\). In a path of \\(n\\) nodes, there are \\(n-1\\) edges that are crossed. If the score of the solution is \\(n-1\\), then all node pairs \\((v_{i},v_{i+1})\\) that are adjacent in \\(P\\) must have had a score of \\(1\\), indicating an edge \\((v_{i},v_{i+1})\\in E\\). Therefore, \\(P\\) must be a Hamiltonian path. If the score of the solution is less than \\(n-1\\), then there is no permutation of \\(V\\) that is also a path, and hence \\(G\\) has no Hamiltonian path.\n\n### Proof of Proposition 2\n\nWe now prove Prop. 2 using a very similar technique as Kushinsky et al. (2019). As the constraintsin Prop. 2 for any value of \\(j\\) do not interact with constraints for other values of \\(j\\), we can assume w.l.o.g. that \\(j\\) takes a single value only and drop it in the notation. We want to solve:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}&\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{x}\\mid\\mid\\mathbf{ z})+\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{Y}\\mid\\mid\\mathbf{W})\\\\ \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{Y}&\\\\ \\operatorname*{subject\\,to}&\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}=1\\\\ &\\sum_{k}\\mathbf{Y}_{ik}=\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\;\\;\\forall i\\end{array} \\tag{13}\\]\n\nWe can find \\(\\mathbf{Y}^{*}=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\mathbf{Y}}\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{Y}\\mid \\mid\\mathbf{W})\\) subject to \\(\\sum_{j}\\mathbf{Y}_{i,j}=\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\) based on Prop. 1: \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{i,j}^{*}=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\mathbf{W}_{i,j}}{\\sum_{j}\\mathbf{W}_ {i,j}}\\). That is, we can express \\(\\mathbf{Y}^{*}\\) as a function of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (which we write \\(\\mathbf{Y}^{*}(\\mathbf{x})\\)), and therefore our overall problem is now a problem in one variable (\\(\\mathbf{x}\\)):\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}&\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{x}\\mid\\mid \\mathbf{z})+\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{Y}^{*}(\\mathbf{x})\\mid\\mid\\mathbf{W})\\\\ \\operatorname*{subject\\,to}&\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}=1\\end{array} \\tag{14}\\]\n\nWe can now rewrite the objective function as\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}&\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{x}\\mid\\mid \\mathbf{q})\\\\ \\operatorname*{subject\\,to}&\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}=1\\end{array} \\tag{15}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{q}_{i}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{z}_{i}\\cdot\\sum_{j^{\\prime}}\\mathbf{W}_{i,j^{ \\prime}}}\\). This step is justified in detail in Fig. 4.\n\nThe rewritten optimization problem has the right form to apply Prop. 1 a second time. We obtain:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{x}_{i}^{*}=\\frac{\\mathbf{q}_{i}}{\\sum_{i^{\\prime}}\\mathbf{q}_{i^{ \\prime}}}\\]\n\nBy plugging this into \\(\\mathbf{Y}^{*}(\\mathbf{x})\\), we obtain the solution to the overall optimization problem.\n\n### Reduction of Eq. (8) to Eq. (6)\n\nIn this section, we show how Eq. (8) can be reduced to a problem of the entropy regularized version of Eq. (6). This is useful because it means we can use Algorithm 1 to solve Eq. (8).\n\nFirst, we show that computing a KL projection is equivalent to solving an entropy-regularized linear program. Let \\(C\\) be the feasible region of the linear constraints.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}&\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in C}\\mathbf{s}^{T} \\mathbf{x}-\\tau\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}(\\log\\mathbf{x}_{i}-1)\\\\ &=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in C}\\tau\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{x}_{i}(\\log \\mathbf{x}_{i}-\\frac{\\mathbf{s}_{i}}{\\tau}-1)\\\\ &=\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{\\mathbf{x}\\in C}\\text{KL}(\\mathbf{x}\\mid\\;\\exp( \\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{\\tau}))\\end{array}\\]Due to this, Eq. (8) is equivalent to a linear program that has the same feasible region as Eq. (6) except for the additional constraint \\(\\mathbf{U}\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\). Note that \\(\\mathbf{U}\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) essentially rules out certain correspondences. Therefore we can approximately enforce \\(\\mathbf{U}\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) by masking \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) such that any forbidden correspondence receives a very low score.\n\n### Derivation of loss function as ELBO\n\nWe now show how the training procedure we use to train our permutation model can be derived from a form of evidence lower bound (ELBO).\n\nIdeally, our permutation model would be a distribution \\(P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) over permutation matrices \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) and we would maximize the marginal likelihood, i.e. marginalizing over all permutations:\n\n\\[P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})=\\sum_{\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathcal{P}}P_ {\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z}^{ \\prime},\\mathbf{R}) \\tag{16}\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{R})=\\prod_{j}\\sum_{i}R_{ij}\\cdot \\mathbb{1}(y_{j}=z_{i})\\) with \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) being the indicator function. \\(P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{R})\\) returns \\(1\\) iff applying the permutation \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\) results in \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). Unfortunately, computing Eq. (16) exactly is intractable in general due to the sum over permutation matrices. We instead use techniques from variational inference and consider the following evidence lower bound (ELBO):\n\n\\[\\log P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\geq \\max_{Q}\\operatorname{E}_{\\mathbf{R}\\sim Q(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{y})}\\log P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{ R})\\] \\[-\\text{KL}(Q(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{y })\\mid\\mid P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})) \\tag{17}\\]\n\nwhere \\(Q(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{y})\\) is an approximate variational posterior. We now relax the restriction that \\(P(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) places non-zero mass only on permutation matrices and use the following definition of \\(P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\):\n\n\\[P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}_{ij}=1|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})=\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s )_{ij}\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{U}^{*}(s)\\) is the solution to Eq. (6) with added entropy regularization.\n\nIt turns out, in our case, we can easily construct a variational posterior \\(Q\\) that has zero reconstruction loss (the first term on the right side in Eq. (17)): we can choose any \\(Q(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{y})\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{ y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) where \\(\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) is the set of bistochastic matrices such that \\(Q(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{y})_{i,j}=0\\) iff \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}_{i}\\neq\\mathbf{y}_{j}\\). To see that this gives zero reconstruction error, consider position \\(j\\) in the output: The probability mass is distributed across precisely those positions \\(i\\) in \\(\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}\\) where the right kind of token lives. In other words, any alignment with non-zero probability will reconstruct the output token at position \\(j\\).\n\nTherefore we can use the following lower bound to the log-likelihood:\n\n\\[\\log\\;P(y|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\geq \\tag{18}\\] \\[-\\min_{Q\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z})}\\text{KL}(Q(\\mathbf{ R}|\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime},\\mathbf{y})\\mid\\mid P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}| \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime}))\\]\n\nDuring training, we need to compute the gradient of Eq. (18). By Danskin's theorem (Danskin, 1967), this is:\n\n\\[-\\nabla_{\\theta}\\text{KL}(Q^{*}\\mid\\mid P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{R}|\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})) \\tag{19}\\]\n\nwhere \\(Q^{*}\\in\\mathcal{Q}(\\mathbf{y},\\mathbf{z}^{\\prime})\\) is the minimizer of Eq. (18). Note that \\(Q^{*}\\) can equivalently be characterised as \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{U}}\\) (Eq. (8)).\n\nIn practice, we also add \\(-\\text{KL}(\\hat{\\mathbf{W}}|\\mathbf{W}^{*}(s))\\) to our objective in Eq. (18) to speed up convergence; this does not change the fact that we use a lower bound.\n\n## Appendix B Additional results and analysis\n\nOkapi.In Fig. 5 we show the accuracy of our model on the document domain in comparison with previous work by number of conjuncts in the logical form.\n\n**Permutation baseline.** A simpler approach for predicting a permutation of the output \\(z^{\\prime}\\) from\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{**BART perm**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Ours**} \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{COGS} & OS & 16\\({}_{\\pm 8}\\) & 33\\({}_{\\pm 24}\\) \\\\  & CP & 17\\({}_{\\pm 3}\\) & 82\\({}_{\\pm 11}\\) \\\\  & PP & 16\\({}_{\\pm 5}\\) & 91\\({}_{\\pm 5}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{ATIS} & iid & 77.10\\({}_{\\pm 1.61}\\) & 76.65\\({}_{\\pm 1.67}\\) \\\\  & Length & 23.81\\({}_{\\pm 9.45}\\) & 41.39\\({}_{\\pm 13.47}\\) \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: Performance of our permutation model in comparison to using BART for predicting the permutation. We ignore the order of conjuncts for evaluation.\n\nFigure 5: Accuracy on the document domain of Okapi by number of conjuncts in the gold logical form.\n\nthe multiset tagging is to use a seq2seq model. In order to compare our approach to such a baseline, we concatenate the original input \\(x\\) with a separator token and \\(z^{\\prime}\\). We then feed this as input to a BART-base model which is trained to predict the output sequence \\(y\\). At inference time, we use beam search and enforce the output to be a permutation of the input. As detailed in Table 6, this approach works well in-distribution and it also shows a small improvement over finetuning BART directly on the length split of ATIS. However, it does not perform as well as our approach. On COGS, our model outperforms the permutation baseline by an even bigger margin. Unseen variable symbols could be a challenge for BART on COGS which might explain part of the gap in performance.\n\nThis approach towards predicting permutations is similar to that of Cazzaro et al. (2023) except that they do not constrain the beam search to permutations. We found that not constraining the output to be a permutation worked worse in the compositional generalization setups.\n\n## Appendix C Further model details\n\n### Parametrization of permutation model\n\nWe do not share parameters between the multiset tagging model and the permutation model.\n\nTokens that appear more than once in the same multiset have the same representation \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}\\) in Eq. (7). In order to distinguish them, we concatenate another embedding to \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}\\): if the token \\(z_{i}^{\\prime}\\) is the \\(k\\)-th instance of its type in its multiset, we concatenate an embedding for \\(k\\) to \\(\\mathbf{h}_{i}^{\\prime}\\). For example, in Fig. 1, \\(z_{5}^{\\prime}=\\) 'x1' and it is the second instance of 'x1' in its multiset, so we use the embedding for \\(2\\).\n\nWe found it helpful to make the temperature \\(\\tau\\) of the scores for Algorithm 1 dependent on the number of elements in the permutation, setting \\(\\tau=(\\log n)^{-1}\\), so that longer sequences have slightly sharper distributions.\n\nSince the permutation model is designed to model exactly permutations, during training, \\(z\\) and \\(y\\) must have the same elements. This is not guaranteed because \\(z\\) is the prediction of the multiset model which may not have perfect accuracy on the training data. For simplicity, we disregard instances where \\(z\\) and \\(y\\) do not have the same elements. In practice, this leads to a very small loss in training data for the permutation model.\n\n### Lexicon mechanism\n\nThe lexicon \\(L\\) is a lookup table that deterministically maps an input token \\(x_{i}\\) to an output token \\(L(x_{i})\\), and we modify the distribution for multiset tagging as follows:\n\n\\[P^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}=k|\\mathbf{x})=\\begin{cases}P(\\mathbf{z}_{i}, \\mathcal{L}=k|\\mathbf{x}_{i})&\\text{ if }v=L(\\mathbf{x}_{i})\\\\ P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}=k|\\mathbf{x})&\\text{ else}\\end{cases}\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}=k|\\mathbf{x})\\) is as defined in Eq. (3) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a special lexicon symbol in the vocabulary. \\(P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,\\mathcal{L}}|\\mathbf{x}_{i})\\) is a distribution over the multiplicity of \\(L(\\mathbf{x}_{i})\\), independent of the identity of \\(L(x_{i})\\). We use the'simple' lexicon induction method by Akyurek and Andreas (2021). Unless otherwise specified during learning, \\(L(\\mathbf{x}_{i})=\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\) like in a copy mechanism.\n\nHandling of variables in COGS.For the COGS dataset, a model has to predict variable symbols. The variables are numbered (0-based) by the input token that introduced it (e.g. in Fig. 1, slept, the third token, introduces a variable symbol \\(\\mathsf{x}_{2}\\)). In order to robustly predict variable symbols for sentences with unseen length, we use a similar mechanism as the lexicon look up table: we introduce another special symbol in the vocabulary, \\(\\mathsf{Var}\\). If \\(\\mathsf{Var}\\) is predicted with a multiplicity of \\(k\\) at \\(i\\)-th input token, it adds the token \\(\\mathsf{x}_{i-1}\\) to its multiset \\(k\\) times.\n\n### Initialization of Multiset Tagging model\n\nIf there are \\(l\\) alignments with a posterior probability of at least \\(\\chi\\) that an input token \\(i\\) produces token \\(v\\), we add the term \\(\\lambda\\log P(\\mathbf{z}_{i,v}\\geq l\\mid\\mathbf{x})\\) to Eq. (4). \\(\\lambda\\) is the hyperparameter determining the strength. This additional loss is only used during the first \\(g\\) epochs.\n\n## Appendix D Datasets and Preprocessing\n\nWe show basic statistics about the data we use in Table 7. Except for the doubling task, all our datasets are in English. COGS uses a small fragment of English generated by a grammar, see Kim and Linzen (2020) for details.\n\nlength 11 are used as development data (e.g. for hyperparameter selection), and examples of length 11 - 20 are used as test data.\n\n### Preprocessing\n\n**COGS.** Unlike Zheng and Lapata (2022); Qiu et al. (2022); Drozdov et al. (2022) we do not apply structural preprocessing to the original COGS meaning representation and keep the variable symbols: all our preprocessing is local and aimed at reducing the length of the logical form (to keep runtimes low). We delete any token in {\",\",\"_\",\"(\",\")\",\"x\",\".\",\";\",\"ND\"} as these do not contribute to the semantics and can be reconstructed easily in post-processing. The tokens {\"agent\", \"theme\", \"recipient\", \"comp\", \"xcomp\", \"nmod\", \"in\", \"on\", \"beside\"} are always preceded by a \".\" and we merge \".\" and any of those tokens into a single token.\n\nExample:\n\n* cookie ( x _ 3 ) ; x table ( x _ 6 ) ; lend. agent ( x _ 1, Dylan ) AND lend. theme ( x _ 1, x _ 3 ) AND lend. recipient ( x _ 1, x _ 9 ) AND cookie. nmod. beside ( x _ 3, x _ 6 ) AND girl ( x _ 9 ) Becomes\n* cookie 3\n* table 6 lend.agent 1 Dylan lend.theme 1 3 lend.recipient 1 9 cookie.nmod.beside 3 6 girl 9\n\n**ATIS.** We follow the pre-processing by Lindemann et al. (2023) and use the variable-free FunQL representation as annotated by Guo et al. (2020). We use space 3.0.5 (model en_core_web_sm) to tokenize the input.\n\n**Okapi.** Again, we follow the preprocessing of Lindemann et al. (2023). We use space 3.0.5 (model en_core_web_sm) to tokenize both the input utterances and the output logical forms.\n\n## Appendix E Details on evaluation metrics\n\nWe provide code for all evaluation metrics in our repository.\n\n**Doubling.** We use exact match accuracy on the string.\n\n**COGS.** For COGS we use exact match accuracy on the sequence in one evaluation setup. The other evaluation setup disregards the order of conjuncts: we first remove the 'preamble' (which contains all the definite descriptions) from the conjunctions. We count a prediction as correct if the set of definite descriptions in the preamble matches the set of definite descriptions in the gold logical form _and_ the set of clauses in the prediction match the set of clauses in the gold logical form.\n\n**ATIS.** We allow for different order of conjuncts between system output and gold parse in computing accuracy. We do this by sorting conjuncts before comparing two trees node by node. This is the same evaluation metric as used by Lindemann et al. (2023).\n\n**Okapi.** We follow Hosseini et al. (2021); Lindemann et al. (2023) and disregard the order of the parameters for computing accuracy. We use a case-insensitive string comparison.\n\n## Appendix F Hyperparameters\n\nWe use the same hyperparameters for all splits of a dataset. For our model, we only tune the hyperparameters of the multiset tagging model; the permutation model is fixed, and we use the same configuration for all tasks where we use RoBERTa. For model ablations where we use an LSTM instead of RoBERTa, we use the same hyperparameters for Okapi and ATIS, and a smaller model for the doubling task. These configurations were determined by hand without tuning. For BART, we use the same hyperparameter as Lindemann et al. (2023).\n\nWe follow the random hyperparameter search procedure of Lindemann et al. (2023) for the multiset tagging models and the LSTM/transformer we train from scratch: we sample 20 configurations and evaluate them on the development set. We run the two best-performing configurations again with a different random seed and pick the one with the highest accuracy (comparing the union of the predicted multisets with the gold multiset).

In machine translation (MT) in particular, sign language translation based on glosses is a prominent approach. In this paper, we review recent works on neural gloss translation. We find that limitations of glosses in general and limitations of specific datasets are not discussed in a transparent manner and that there is no common standard for evaluation. To address these issues, we put forward concrete recommendations for future research on gloss translation. Our suggestions advocate awareness of the inherent limitations of gloss-based approaches, realistic datasets, stronger baselines and convincing evaluation.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAutomatic sign language processing is becoming more popular in NLP research (Yin et al., 2021). In machine translation (MT) in particular, many recent publications have proposed sign language translation (SLT) based on _glosses_. Glosses provide semantic labels for individual signs. They typically consist of the base form of a word in the surrounding spoken language written in capital letters (see Table 1). Even though glosses are not a complete representation of signs (see e.g. Pizzuto et al. 2006), they are often adopted in MT because, by virtue of being textual, they fit seamlessly into existing MT pipelines and existing methods seemingly require the least modification.\n\nIn this paper, we review recent works on neural gloss translation. We find that limitations of gloss-based approaches in general and limitations of specific datasets are not transparently discussed as inherent shortcomings. Furthermore, among gloss translation papers there is no common standard for evaluation, especially regarding the exact method to compute BLEU scores.\n\nExperiments in SLT should be informed by sign language expertise and should be performed according to the best practices already established in the MT community.\n\nTo alleviate these problems going forward, we make practical recommendations for future research on gloss translation.\n\nOur paper makes the following contributions:\n\n* We provide a review of recent works on gloss translation (SS2).\n* We outline recommendations for future work which promote awareness of the inherent limitations of gloss-based approaches, realistic datasets, stronger baselines and convincing evaluation (SS3).\n\n## 2 Related work\n\nFor a general, interdisciplinary introduction to sign language processing see Bragg et al.

We report characteristics such as the datasets used, translation directions, and evaluation details (Table 2). Our informal procedure of selecting papers is detailed in Appendix A.\n\n### Awareness of limitations of gloss approach\n\nWe find that 8 out of 14 reviewed works do not include an adequate discussion of the limitations of gloss approaches, inadvertently overstating the potential usefulness of their experiments.\n\nIn the context of sign languages, glosses are unique identifiers for individual signs. However, a linear sequence of glosses is not an adequate representation of a signed utterance, where different channels (manual and non-manual) are engaged simultaneously. Linguistically relevant cues such as non-manual movement or use of three-dimensional space may be missing (Yin et al., 2021).\n\nThe gloss transcription conventions of different corpora vary greatly, as does the level of detail (see Kopf et al. (2022) for an overview of differences and commonalities between corpora). Therefore, glosses in different corpora or across languages are not comparable. Gloss transcription is an enormously laborious process done by expert linguists.\n\nBesides, glosses are a linguistic tool, not a writing system established in Deaf communities. Sign language users generally do not read or write glosses in their everyday lives.\n\nTaken together, this means that gloss translation suffers from an inherent and irrecoverable information loss, that creating an abundance of translations transcribed as glosses is unrealistic, and that gloss translation systems are not immediately useful to end users.\n\n### Choice of dataset\n\nAll reviewed works use the RWTH-PHOENIX Weather 2014T (hereafter abbreviated as _PHOENIX_) dataset (Forster et al., 2014; Camgoz et al., 2018) while other datasets are used far less frequently. Besides, we note a distinct paucity of languages and translation directions: 12 out of 14 works are concerned only with translation between German Sign Language (DGS) and German (DE), the language pair of the PHOENIX dataset.\n\nWhile PHOENIX was a breakthrough when it was published, it is of limited use for current research. The dataset is small (8k sentence pairs) and contains only weather reports, covering a very narrow linguistic domain. It is important to discuss the exact nature of glosses, how the corpus was created and how it is distributed.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline  & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{L}}{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}\\) & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**datasets**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**translation directions**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**code**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**evaluation metrics**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**BLEU tool**} \\\\ \\cline{3-11}  & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{P}}{\\mathbf{O}}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{DGS}-\\mathbf{DE}}{\\mathbf{DE}-\\mathbf{DGS}}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{DGS}}{\\mathbf{O}}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{DGS}}{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{1}\\mathbf{3}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{4}}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{4}}{\\mathbf{R}}\\) & \\(\\frac{\\mathbf{O}}{\\mathbf{O}}\\) & & & & \\\\ \\hline Cangot et al.

The broadcast videos served as input for the DGS side of the parallel corpus. Compared to the glossing conventions of other well-known corpora, PHOENIX glosses are simplistic and capture mostly manual features (with mouthings as the only non-manual activity), which is not sufficient to represent meaning (SS2.1).\n\nLive interpretation and translationese effectsThe fact that PHOENIX data comes from interpretation in a live setting has two implications: Firstly, since information was conveyed at high speed, the sign language interpreters omitted pieces of information from time to time. This leads to an information mismatch between some German sentences and their DGS counterparts. Secondly, due to the high speed of transmission, the (hearing) interpreters sometimes followed the grammar of German more closely than that of DGS, amounting to a translationese effect.\n\nPreprocessing of spoken languageThe German side of the PHOENIX corpus is available only already tokenized, lowercased and with punctuation symbols removed. From an MT perspective this is unexpected since corpora are usually distributed without such preprocessing.\n\nPHOENIX is popular because it is freely available and is a benchmark with clearly defined data splits introduced by Camgoz et al. (2018). SLT as a field is experiencing a shortage of free and open datasets and, with the exception of PHOENIX, there are no agreed-upon data splits.\n\nEssentially, from a scientific point of view achieving higher gloss translation quality on the PHOENIX dataset is near meaningless. The apparent overuse of PHOENIX is reminiscent of the overuse of MNIST (LeCun et al., 2010) in machine learning, or the overuse of the WMT 14 English-German benchmark in the MT community, popularized by Vaswani et al. (2017).\n\nAlternative corporaIn Table 3 we list several alternatives to PHOENIX, to exemplify how other corpora are preferable in different ways. For example, in PHOENIX the sign language data is produced by hearing interpreters in a live interpretation setting. In contrast, the Public DGS Corpus and FocusNews contain original (non-translated) signing material produced by deaf signers. PHOENIX is limited to weather reports, while all other corpora listed in Table 3 feature much broader domains. The number of different signs found in PHOENIX is also small compared to alternative corpora. For instance, the sign vocabulary of BOBSL is twice as large as for PHOENIX, which corroborates that the language data in BOBSL indeed is more varied. Besides, BOBSL also is vastly bigger than PHOENIX and features more individual signers.\n\n### Evaluation\n\nAs evaluation metrics, all works use some variant of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and ten out of 14 use some variant of ROUGE (Lin, 2004). All but four papers do not contain enough information about how exactly BLEU was computed. Different BLEU implementations, settings (e.g. ngram orders, tokenization schemes) and versions are used.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l} \\hline \\hline  & **domains** & **language pair** & **\\#signs** & **\\# hours** & **\\#signers** & **signing origin** & **glosses?** \\\\ \\hline PHOENIX (Forster et al., 2014) & weather (Cang\u00f3z et al., 2018) & DGS\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)DE & 1066 & 11 & 9 & LI & \\(\\blacklozenge\\) \\\\ \\hline Public DGS Corpus (Hanke et al., 2020) & conversation, storytelling & DGS\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)DE & 8580\\({}^{*}\\) & 50 & 330 & OS & \\(\\blacklozenge\\) \\\\ \\hline BOBSL (Albanie et al., 2021) & general broadcast programs & BSL\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)EN & 2281 & 1467 & 39 & LI & - \\\\ \\hline FocusNews (M\u00fcller et al., 2022) & general news & DSGS\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)DE & - & 19 & 12 & OS & - \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Comparison between PHOENIX and a small selection of alternative corpora. DGS=German Sign Language, DE=German, BSL=British Sign Language, DSSG=Swiss German Sign Language, #signs=number of unique signs (if available), #signers=number of individual signers, LI=live interpretation, OS=signing is the original source material, then translated to spoken language text. \\({}^{*}\\)=after preprocessing the glosses as described in Appendix C.\n\nNon-standard metricsROUGE is a metric common in automatic summarization but not in MT, and was never correlated with human judgement in a large study. In eight out of 14 papers, BLEU is used with a non-standard maximum ngram order, producing variants such as BLEU-1, BLEU-2, etc. Similar to ROUGE, these variants of BLEU have never been validated as metrics of translation quality, and their use is scientifically unmotivated.\n\nTokenizationBLEU requires tokenized machine translations and references. Modern tools therefore apply a tokenization procedure internally and implicitly (independently of the MT system's preprocessing). Computing BLEU with tokenization on glosses leads to seemingly better scores but is misleading since tokenization creates trivial matches. For instance, in corpora that make use of the character $ in glosses (e.g. the DGS Corpus Konrad et al. (2022)), $ is split off as a single character, inflating the ngram sub-scores. For an illustration see Table 4 (and Appendix B for a complete code listing) where we demonstrate that using or omitting tokenization leads to a difference of 15 BLEU.\n\nSpurious gainsDifferent implementations of BLEU or different tokenizations lead to differences in BLEU bigger than what many papers describe as an \"improvement\" over previous work Post (2018). Incorrectly attributing such improvements to, for instance, changes to the model architecture amounts to a \"failure to identify the sources of empirical gains\" Lipton and Steinhardt (2019). In a similar vein, we observe that papers on gloss translation tend to copy scores from previous papers without knowing whether the evaluation procedures are in fact the same. This constitutes a general trend in recent MT literature Marie et al. (2021).\n\nIn summary, some previous works on gloss translation have used 1) automatic metrics that are not suitable for MT or 2) well-established MT metrics in ways that are not recommended. BLEU with standard settings and tools is inappropriate for gloss outputs.\n\nThe recommended way to compute BLEU on gloss output is to use the tool SacreBLEU Post (2018) and to disable internal tokenization. Nevertheless, even with these precautions, it is important to note that BLEU was never validated empirically as an evaluation metric for gloss output. Some aspects of BLEU may not be adequate for a sequence of glosses, such as its emphasis on whitespaces to mark the boundaries of meaningful units that are the basis of the final score.\n\nOther string-based metrics such as CHRF Popovic (2016) may be viable alternatives for gloss evaluation. CHRF is a character-based metric and its correlation with human judgement is at least as good as BLEU's Kocmi et al. (2021).\n\nOn a broader note, we do not advocate BLEU in particular, but advocate that any evaluation metric is used according to best practices in MT. Some of the best practices (such as reporting the metric signature) equally apply to all metrics. A key limitation regarding choosing a metric is that many metrics that are indeed advocated today, such as COMET Rei et al. (2020), cannot be used for gloss outputs because this \"language\" is not supported by COMET. There are also hardly any human judgement scores to train new versions of neural metrics.\n\n### Further observations\n\nMore informally (beyond what we show in Table 2), we observe that most papers do not process glosses in any corpus-specific way, and that particular modeling and training decisions may not be ideal for low-resource gloss translation.\n\nPreprocessing glossesGlosses are created for linguistic purposes (SS2.1), not necessarily with machine translation in mind. Particular gloss parts are not relevant for translation and, if kept, make the problem harder unnecessarily. For instance, a corpus transcription and annotation scheme might prescribe that meaning-equivalent, minor form variants of signs are transcribed as different glosses.\n\nAs the particular nature of glosses is specific to\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l} \\hline \\hline\n**Reference** & VIEL1A FAMILIE1* \\{\\} \\\\  & WOHNUNGE2* \\{\\} \\\\\n**Hypothesis** & VIEL1B JUNG1 LEBENI GERNI* \\{\\} \\\\ \\hline\n**BLEU with tokenization** & 25.61 \\\\\n**BLEU without tokenization** & 10.18 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Impact of applying or disabling internal tokenization (mtv13a) when computing BLEU on gloss outputs. Example taken from the Public DGS Corpus Hanke et al. (2020).\n\neach corpus, it is necessary to preprocess glosses in a corpus-specific way. We illustrate corpus-specific gloss processing in Appendix C, using the Public DGS Corpus Hanke et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nModeling and training decisionsGloss translation experiments are certainly low-resource scenarios and therefore, best practices for optimizing MT systems on low-resource datasets apply Sennrich and Zhang (2019). For example, dropout rates or label smoothing should be set accordingly, and the vocabulary of a subword model should be generally small Ding et al. (2019).\n\nGloss translation models are often compared to other approaches as baselines, it is therefore problematic if those gloss baselines are weak and unoptimized Denkowski and Neubig (2017).\n\n## 3 Recommendations for gloss translation\n\nBased on our review of recent works on gloss translation, we make the following recommendations for future research:\n\n* Demonstrate awareness of limitations of gloss approaches (SS2.1) and explicitly discuss them.\n* Focus on datasets beyond PHOENIX. Openly discuss the limited size and linguistic domain of PHOENIX (SS2.2).\n* Use metrics that are well-established in MT. If BLEU is used, compute it with SacreBLEU, report metric signatures and disable internal tokenization for gloss outputs. Do not compare to scores produced with a different or unknown evaluation procedure (SS2.3).\n* Given that glossing is corpus-specific (SS2.1), process glosses in a corpus-specific way, informed by transcription conventions (SS2.4).\n* Optimize gloss translation baselines with methods shown to be effective for low-resource MT (SS2.4).\n\nWe also believe that publishing reproducible code makes works on gloss translation more valuable to the scientific community.\n\nJustification for recommendationsThere is an apparent tension between making recommendations for future work on gloss translation and at the same time claiming that the paradigm of gloss translation is inadequate to begin with (SS2.1). But importantly, further works on gloss translation are likely because MT researchers have a preference for text-based translation problems and little awareness of sign linguistics. If further research is conducted, it should be based on sound scientific methodology.\n\n## 4 Alternatives to gloss translation\n\nIn previous sections we have established that glosses are a lossy representation of sign language. We also argued that the most prominent benchmark corpus for gloss translation (PHOENIX) is inadequate, but other, preferable corpora do not contain glosses. This begs the question: if not gloss translation, what other approach should be pursued?\n\nRepresenting sign languageAlternatives include translation models that extract features directly from video, generate video directly or use pose estimation data as a sign language representation Tarres et al. (2023); Muller et al. (2022). A distinct advantage of such systems is that they produce a sign language output that is immediately useful to a user, whereas glosses are only an intermediate output that are not intelligible by themselves.\n\nIf a system generates a continuous output such as a video, then evaluating translation quality with an automatic metric is largely an unsolved problem. Even though there are recent proposals for metrics (e.g. Arkushin et al. (2023), more fundamental research in this direction is still required.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper we have shown that some recent works on gloss translation lack awareness of the inherent limitations of glosses and common datasets, as well as a standardized evaluation method (SS2). In order to make future research on gloss translation more meaningful, we make practical recommendations for the field (SS3).\n\nWe urge researchers to spell out limitations of gloss translation approaches, e.g. in the now mandatory limitation sections of *ACL papers, and to strengthen their findings by implementing existing best practices in MT.\n\nFinally, we also caution that researchers should consider whether gloss translation is worthwhile, and if time and effort would be better spent on basic linguistic tools (such as segmentation, alignment or coreference resolution), creating training corpora or translation methods that do not rely on glosses.\n\n### Limitations\n\nOur approach to surveying the research literature has limitations. Firstly, some characterizations of the published works we survey are subjective. For example, it is somewhat subjective whether a paper \"includes an adequate discussion of the limitations of glosses\" and somewhat subjective whether the evaluation procedure is explained in enough detail.\n\nFurthermore, it is likely that our survey missed some existing publications, especially if published in other contexts than NLP and machine learning conferences and journals. This may have skewed our findings.\n\nFinally, the statements and recommendations in this paper are valid only as long as automatic glossing from video is not feasible. If a scientific breakthrough is achieved in the future, the relevance of glosses for sign language translation may need to be re-evaluated.\n\n### Data licensing\n\nThe license of the Public DGS Corpus1 (which we use only as examples in Table 4 and Appendix C) does not allow any computational research except if express permission is given by the University of Hamburg.\n\nFootnote 1: [https://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/meindegs/ling/license_en.html](https://www.sign-lang.uni-hamburg.de/meindegs/ling/license_en.html)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was funded by the EU Horizon 2020 project EASIER (grant agreement no. 101016982), the Swiss Innovation Agency (Innousisse) flagship IICT (PFFS-21-47) and the EU Horizon 2020 project iEXTRACT (grant agreement no. 802774).\n\nWe thank the DGS Corpus team at the University of Hamburg for helpful discussions on gloss preprocessing.

To DGS glosses we suggest to apply the following modifications derived from the DGS Corpus transcription conventions (Konrad et al., 2022):\n\n* Removing entirely two specific gloss types that cannot possibly help the translation: $GEST-OFF and $SEXTRA-LING-MAN.\n* Removing _ad-hoc_ deviations from citation forms, marked by \\(\\star\\). Example: \\(\\texttt{ANDERS1}\\star\\rightarrow\\texttt{ANDERS1}\\).\n* Removing the distinction between type glosses and subtype glosses, marked by \\(\\hat{\\cdot}\\). Example: \\(\\texttt{WISSEN2B}^{\\star}\\rightarrow\\texttt{WISSEN2B}\\).\n* Collapsing phonological variations of the same type that are meaning-equivalent. Such variants are marked with uppercase letter suffixes. Example: \\(\\texttt{WISSEN2B}\\rightarrow\\texttt{WISSEN2}\\).\n\n* Deliberately keep numerals ($NUM), list glosses ($LIST) and finger alphabet ($ALPHA) intact, except for removing handshape variants.\n\nSee Table 5 for examples for this preprocessing step. Overall these simplifications should reduce the number of observed forms while not affecting the machine translation task. For other purposes such as linguistic analysis our preprocessing would of course be detrimental.\n\nWhile this preprocessing method provides a good baseline, it can certainly be refined further. For instance, the treatment of two-handed signs could be improved. If a gloss occurs simultaneously on both hands, we either keep both glosses or remove one occurrence. In both cases, information about the simultaneity of signs is lost during preprocessing and preserving it could potentially improve translation.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l} \\hline \\hline\n**before** & \\$INDEX1 \\$ENDE1\u2019 ANDERS1* SEHEN1 \\$MUNCHEN19* BEREICH1A* \\\\\n**after** & \\$INDEX1 \\$ENDE1 \\$ENDE1 \\$ENDE1 \\$ENDE1 \\$MUNCHEN1 BEREICH1 \\\\ \\hline\n**before** & ICHI \\$ETWAS-PLANEN-UND-UNSETZEN1 \\$ELBST1A* KLAPPT1* \\$GEST-OFF* \\$IES-JETZT1 \\\\\n**after** & \\$GEST-OFF* \\$GEST-OFF* \\$ICH \\$ETWAS-PLANEN-UND-UNSETZEN1 \\$ELBST1 \\$KLAPPT1 \\$IES-JETZT1 \\$GEWOHNHEIT1 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 5: Examples for preprocessing of DGS glosses.\n\n**ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist**\n\nA For every submission:\n\nA1.

The one-hop annotation manner made ATOMIC a set of independent bipartite graphs, which ignored the numerous links between events in different bipartite graphs and consequently caused shortages in knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths. In this work, we aim to construct Dense-ATOMIC with high knowledge coverage and massive multi-hop paths. The events in ATOMIC are normalized to a consistent pattern at first. We then propose a CSKG completion method called Rel-CSKGC to predict the relation given the head event and the tail event of a triplet, and train a CSKG completion model based on existing triplets in ATOMIC. We finally utilize the model to complete the missing links in ATOMIC and accordingly construct Dense-ATOMIC. Both automatic and human evaluation on an annotated subgraph of ATOMIC demonstrate the advantage of Rel-CSKGC over strong baselines. We further conduct extensive evaluations on Dense-ATOMIC in terms of statistics, human evaluation, and simple downstream tasks, all proving Dense-ATOMIC\u2019s advantages in Knowledge Coverage and Multi-hop Paths. Both the source code of Rel-CSKGC and Dense-ATOMIC are publicly available on <https://github.com/NUSTM/Dense-ATOMIC>.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAtomic is a large-scale human-annotated commonsense knowledge graph focusing on the inferential knowledge in social life (Sap et al., 2019). It consists of nine _if-then_ relation types describing the causes, effects, agent, staticy, and theme of an event. The research on Atomic has drawn more and more attention in recent years. An increasing number of downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning (Yu et al., 2022), storytelling (Brahman and Chaturvedi, 2020), question answering (Heo et al., 2022), dialog generation (Wu et al., 2022), etc., have improved their performances by acquiring and utilizing the commonsense knowledge from Atomic.\n\nCurrently, Atomic was constructed under one-hop annotations. It began with 24,000 pre-defined base events and nine relation types. For each base event and each relation, the annotators were asked to write a possible tail event based on one-hop reasoning. As shown in Figure 1, given the base event _\"X asks Y to marry\"_, the annotated tail events can be _\"loving\"_ under the relation of _\"xAttr\"_, _\"smiles\"_ under the relation of _\"xEffect\"_, and _\"says yes\"_ under the relation of _\"Effect\"_.\n\nIn such a one-hop annotation manner, each base event and its related annotated tail events shape a bipartite graph containing only \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) links, where \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) denotes the **B**ase event and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) denotes the **A**nnotated tail event. Thereby, the whole graph of Atomic can be viewed as a set of \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) bipartite graphs, while the \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) links between different bipartite graphs were almost ignored. In Figure 1, the dashed lines illustrate such missing links in Atomic, e.g., an annotated tail event _\"in front of Y\"_ and a base event _\"X asks Y to marry\"_ in two different bipartite graphs miss a link of the _\"xIntent\"_ relation.\n\nThis leads to two shortcomings of Atomic. Firstly, with only \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) links, Atomic contains very few multi-hop paths, since an annotated tail event cannot become the _head event_ of a triplet. Secondly, missing \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) links cause unsatisfactory knowledge coverage, despite its high-quality human-annotated commonsense knowledge. Both shortcomings limit the potential of Atomic in practical applications. Intuitively, an ideal CSKG requires high knowledge coverage to meet the needs of various tasks, and massive multi-hop paths to understand the evolution between different events.\n\nIn this work, we aim to construct a densely-connected Atomic. The key is to complete different types of missing links, leading to denser Atomic with high knowledge coverage and massive multi-hop paths. We achieve this goal through three main steps: Normalizing Tail Events, Training a Relation Prediction Model and Constructing Dense-Atomic.\n\nFirstly, most of the annotated tail events in Atomic have different patterns to the base events, so we normalize annotated tail events in Atomic to a consistent pattern (_\"Subject + Verb + Object\"_), to facilitate subsequent CSKG completion. Specific relations are also grouped to mitigate ambiguity.\n\nSecondly, we train a relation prediction model based on a set of existing triplets in Atomic to infer the missing links on the whole graph, _i.e._, CSKG completion upon Atomic. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing studies for CSKG completion utilized the translation based methods, which formalized the CSKG completion as a _tail event_ ranking task given the _head event_ and the relation. A graph convolutional network (GCN) was mostly employed to encode the graph embeddings of events, but its performance is unsatisfactory since the sparsity of Atomic limits the information propagation on the GCN (Malaviya et al., 2020). In contrast, in this work, we propose a method called Rel-CSKGC, which regards CSKG completion as a relation prediction problem given the _head event_ and the _tail event_, and accordingly train a CSKG completion model based on Atomic.\n\nFinally, based on the CSKG completion model, we construct Dense-Atomic by inferring the missing links on Atomic. Figure 1 illustrates the main differences between Atomic and Dense-Atomic.\n\nWe conduct extensive evaluations towards the Rel-CSKGC method and the constructed Dense-Atomic, respectively.\n\nFirst, we compare Rel-CSKGC with several newly proposed relation prediction methods and translation based methods. Both automatic evaluation on an annotated subgraph and human evaluation on 500 sampled triplets show the advantage of Rel-CSKGC for completion on Atomic.\n\nNext, we evaluate Dense-Atomic from the perspectives of knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted in terms of statistics, human evaluation, and simple downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that Dense-ATOMIC surpasses ATOMIC in terms of triplet counts by an order of magnitude, and multi-hop paths by more than two orders of magnitude, respectively, while at the same time maintaining its quality.\n\n## 2 Approach\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the procedure of constructing Dense-Atomic, consisting of three main steps:\n\nFigure 1: Atomic vs. Dense-Atomic. Firstly, Dense-Atomic completes many missing links in Atomic, including \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\), \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) links, _e.g._, missing \u201coPersona\u201d link between _\u201cX proposes marriage\u201d_ and _\u201cY is delightful\u201d_ (type: \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\)); Secondly, Dense-Atomic contains more multi-hop paths, e.g., a two-hop path _\u201cX asks Y to marry\u201d_\\(\\rightarrow\\)_\u201cY says yes\u201d_\\(\\rightarrow\\)_\u201cX smiles\u201d_ after predicting missing links on normalizd Atomic.\n\nMormalizing Tail Events, Training a Relation Prediction Model, and Constructing Dense-Atomic.\n\n### Normalizing Tail Events\n\nAtomic contains only \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) triplets. A CSKG completion model trained with \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) triplets is inapplicable to predict \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\), \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{A}\\), and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)-to-\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) links, since base events (usually sentences) and annotated tail events (usually phrases or words) have different patterns. This results in a shortage of knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths during the completion.\n\nTo this end, we propose Normalizing Tail Events to convert annotated tail events to the same pattern as the base events, including subject removal, third person singular form conjugation, subject recovery, and relation grouping.\n\nSubject RemovalFor a few annotated tail events being complete sentences, we perform dependency tree parsing and part-of-speech tagging with CoreNLP Manning et al. (2014) and remove subjects based on the two kinds of structure patterns, which makes the nodes in the graph become a uniform pattern and benefits the subject recovery process. For example, given a tail event \"He smiles\", we first remove the subject \"He\" and convert it to a universal expression \"Y smiles\" in the subject recovery process.\n\nThird Person Singular Form ConjugationIn our preliminary experiments, a CSKG completion model tends to correlate phrases starting with _\"to\"_ with relations such as _\"xWant\"_, _\"xIntent\"_, so we leverage WordNet Miller (1995) to acquire the verb root and add the suffix (-s, -es, etc.) according to English grammar.\n\nSubject RecoveryWe add subjects to processed annotated tail events based on different relations.\n\nRelation GroupingBoth _\"xWant\"_ and _\"xEffect\"_ describe the possible subsequent events, distinguished by _\"to\"_ representing subject will. After third person singular form conjugation, the two relations may lead to ambiguity. We perform relation grouping for all these relations to mitigate ambiguity. _\"xEffect\"_ and _\"xWant\"_ form _\"xAfter\"_ describing _what will happen to X. _\"oEffect\"_ and _\"oWant\"_ form _\"oAfter\"_ describing _what will happen to Y. _\"xAttr\"_ and _\"xReact\"_ form _\"xPersona\"_ describing _how X feels or is described._ It should be noted that the relation grouping process leads to a non-serious problem, i.e., the grouped relation cannot distinguish between subjective and objective semantics. However, it mitigates Atomic's sparsity issue and improves the performance of the relation prediction model.\n\nDue to the page limitation, the pseudo-code of normalizing tail events is present in Appendix A.\n\nFigure 2: Procedure of constructing Dense-Atomic.\n\nIt is worth noting that our normalization method resembles a prior work (Fang et al., 2021b, a). Their purpose is to align Atomic with other CSKGs, while we focus on event alignment in Atomic by eliminating differences among different events.\n\n### Training a Relation Prediction Model\n\n#### 2.2.1 Limitation of Traditional Methods\n\nTraditional methods for the completion of Atomic proposed to score all candidate _tail events_ given the _head event_ and the relation. The GCN for encoding graph embeddings of events induced two shortcomings: 1) it is difficult for a GCN to propagate information due to the sparse graph structure of Atomic(Malaviya et al., 2020); 2) it cannot sufficiently utilize semantic information of events.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Our Rel-CSKGC Method\n\nTo address these issues, we propose Rel-CSKGC, as illustrated in Figure 3. Specifically, Atomic is first decomposed into independent triplets, and then Rel-CSKGC predicts the relation given the _head event_ and the _tail event_ of a triplet. Rel-CSKGC utilizes no graph structure information thus avoiding the problem caused by the sparsity. Additionally, encoding both the _head event_ and the _tail event_ with the pretrained language model successfully takes advantage of semantic information.\n\nProblem FormulationGiven a CSKG \\(G=(N,V)\\), where \\(N\\) is the set of nodes and \\(V\\) is the set of edges, we consider a single training instance as a triplet \\(v_{i}=(h,r,t)\\) with the _head event_\\(h\\), _relation type_\\(r\\) and the _tail event_\\(t\\). Here, \\(r\\in V\\) and \\(h,t\\in N\\). The objective of Rel-CSKGC is to predict the most reasonable \\(r\\) given \\(h\\) and \\(t\\). 1\n\nFootnote 1: To keep Atomic concise, we only predict the most reasonable relation in this work.\n\nMain StructureWe utilize RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to acquire contextual representations of free-form texts describing events. The input is the concatenation of \\(h\\) and \\(t\\). We acquire the embedding matrix of \\(h\\) and \\(t\\) by:\n\n\\[[H;T]=\\text{RoBERTa}([h;t]) \\tag{1}\\]\n\nwhere \\(H\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|N|\\times D}\\) and \\(T\\in\\mathbb{R}^{|N|\\times D}\\). \\(|N|\\) is the number of tokens of the event, and \\(D\\) is the dimensionality of representation. We apply max pooling on \\(H\\) and \\(T\\) to acquire sentence embeddings \\(e_{h}\\) and \\(e_{t}\\). The objective function can be defined with trainable weights \\(W_{t}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times D}\\) and \\(W_{c}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times 2D}\\):\n\n\\[o=\\text{sigmoid}(W_{t}e_{\\text{}})+\\text{softmax}(W_{c}(e_{h},e_{t})) \\tag{2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(K\\) is the number of relations and \\(e_{\\text{}}\\) the embedding of -token used as a indicator for whether \\(h\\) and \\(t\\) are related.\n\nNegative SamplingRel-CSKGC requires negative samples to predict _unlinkable_ links. We consider the following two strategies to construct negative samples: 1) **Random** negative sampling. For a gold triplet, we randomly select an event from normalized Atomic as the new _tail event_ to replace the original _tail event_; 2) **Persona** negative sampling. Triplets under relations of _\"xPersona\"_ and _\"oPersona\"_ follow the pattern of _\"Subject + is + Adjective\"_ and account for a large part in Atomic. Models tend to always predict _\"xPersona\"_ or _\"oPersona\"_ when the given tail event follows the pattern of _\"Subject + is + Adjective\"_. To alleviate this problem, we specifically construct negative samples by replacing the _tail event_ of triplets under relations of _\"xPersona\"_ and _\"oPersona\"_ with a randomly-chosen event containing \"is\".\n\n### Constructing Dense-Atomic\n\nBased on Rel-CSKGC, we train a relation prediction model with existing triplets in Atomic and then use the model to complete missing links in Atomic. We adopt threshold-based link prediction to decide whether two events are related and propose an intra-and-inter cluster completion strategy to reduce the cost of completing entire Atomic.\n\nThreshold-based Link PredictionThreshold-based link prediction (TLP) is a heuristic strategy to decide whether a relation is acceptable according to the probability predicted by Rel-CSKGC. Different thresholds are specifically tuned for different relations. The model predicts the relation\n\nFigure 3: The detailed structure of Rel-CSKGC.\n\nonly if the final probability is above the corresponding threshold. TLP is used in all our models as the last step for the link acceptance decision.\n\nIntra-and-inter Cluster Completion StrategySince it's computationally expensive to iterate over all pairs of _head_ and _tail events_ during the inference, we design an intra-and-inter cluster completion strategy to trade off between the completion scale and the time complexity. In Figure 1, we consider each base event and its annotated tail events as a _cluster_. **Intra-cluster completion** infers missing links inside a cluster. Intuitively, annotated tail events in one cluster, written based on the same base event, are highly related and may contain more missing links. **Inter-cluster completion** infers missing links between different clusters. Annotated tail events in different clusters are written independently based on different base events, thus links between different clusters are under-explored.\n\nDue to the limited computing resource and time, we temporarily provide the results of 100 sampled clusters in this paper. Increasing the sampling size can further improve the scale of Dense-Atomic, but that will also linearly increases the computational cost. We will release versions with larger sampling sizes later.\n\n## 3 Evaluation of Our Rel-CSKGC Method\n\nIn this section, we compare Rel-CSKGC with relation prediction and translation based methods by experimenting on a newly annotated subgraph and human evaluation.\n\n### Training and Test Set Construction\n\nTraining Set with Negative SamplingFollowing Sap et al. (2019)'s split of Atomic, we randomly sample negative triplets from the training split with negative sampling strategies introduced in Section 2.2. We combine sampled negative triplets and the training split to construct the training set for Rel-CSKGC. The statistic of the training set is illustrated in Table 1. 2\n\nFootnote 2: The imbalance between random and persona negative sampling methods was established based on a preliminary experiment, which provided insights into optimal sampling sizes.\n\nTest Set with Annotated SubgraphTo test the performance of Rel-CSKGC, we construct a ground-truth subgraph by randomly sampling three clusters from the test split and annotating all pairs of _head events_ and _tail events_ with the most reasonable relation. The statistic of the annotated ground-truth subgraph is shown in Table 2.\n\n### Compared Methods\n\nWe select 4 baselines comprising two different types of CSKG completion methods and use the specific evaluation protocol for each of them.\n\n#### 3.2.1 Relation Prediction Methods\n\nBaselinesWe adapt **CE-random**(Li et al., 2016), a method augmenting CSKGs by scoring novel tuples, to predict the missing relation. We also compare **KG-BERT**(Yao et al., 2019), which probes the performance of relation prediction methods on knowledge graphs. Note that we replace BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) in KG-BERT for fair comparison.\n\nEvaluation ProtocalRanking metrics (HITS and Mean Reciprocal Rank) designed for translation based methods are not applicable to relation prediction methods. By valuing precision more than recall on CSKG completion, we utilize precision for the evaluation of relation prediction methods.\n\n#### 3.2.2 Translation Based Methods\n\nBaselinesSynLinkMalaviya et al. (2020) proposed to densify the CSKG with synthetic links for better graph representation. **InductiveE**(Wang et al., 2021) introduced indutive learning on the CSKG by enhancing the unseen event representations with neighboring structure information.\n\nEvaluation ProtocalTo handle the evaluation mismatch between Rel-CSKGC and translation\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c} \\hline \\hline Atomic & Rand.

Intra and Inter indicate the intra- and inter- cluster, respectively.\n\nbased methods, we designed a transformation strategy. Specifically, we randomly sample 500 triplets from Malaviya et al. (2020)'s test split. For SynLink and InductivE, a threshold is set for hit@1 score, and a _tail event_ is accepted only when the score is above the threshold. We tune the threshold to ensure the number of triplets inferred by Rel-CSKGC, SynLink, and InductivE close on these 500 triplets. We then calculate the proportion of meaningful triplets for different methods manually.3\n\nFootnote 3: In the given context, \u201cmeaningful triplets\u201d refer to triplets that are considered reasonable, coherent, and non-contradictory by human evaluators.\n\n### Main Results\n\nRelation Prediction MethodsIn Table 3, we compare Rel-CSKGC with different relation prediction methods, and Rel-CSKGC achieves consistent improvement on the test set of the annotated subgraph. Paired \\(t\\)-Test result proves that the improvement of Rel-CSKGC is significant. From Table 3, we can observe that the precision of intra-cluster completion is significantly higher than that of inter-cluster completion for all methods. This demonstrates that tail events annotated based on the same base event are highly related to each other and easier for models to predict relations, while the prediction for inter-cluster events is more challenging.\n\nTranslation Based MethodsAfter carefully tuning the threshold based on the strategy in Section 3.2.2, Rel-CSKGC, SynLink, and InductivE predict 174, 133, and 132 triplets on 500 randomly sampled triplets. In Table 4, Rel-CSKGC outperforms SynLink and InductivE by a large margin on proportion and the number of meaningful triplets.\n\n### Human Evaluation\n\nMotivationUpon observing predictions of Rel-CSKGC, we note that some triplets could be reasonable, while the annotated subgraph doesn't cover them. For example, given a _head event_ \"X accepts Y's apology\" and a _tail event_ \"X is generous\", the annotated ground-truth relation is \"xPersona\", while Rel-CSKGC could predict another reasonable relation \"xIntent\". Consequently, we perform the human evaluation to check whether a predicted triplet is actually meaningful.\n\nResultWe can find from the last row of Table 3 that Rel-CSKGC achieves an even higher precision of 0.80, suggesting that Rel-CSKGC can predict reasonable triplets neglected during the subgraph annotation. The high precision by human evaluation also guarantees the quality of predicted triplets.\n\n### Ablation Study\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of negative sampling, we report experimental results without negative sampling in Table 3. The performance of Rel-CSKGC drops dramatically without any negative sampling strategies, validating the effectiveness of negative sampling.\n\nBy experimenting Rel-CSKGC with different scales of random negative samples in Figure 4, we find that the precision of Rel-CSKGC increases using both automatic and human evaluation as more negative samples are used for training.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline \\hline Method & \\# Predicted & \\# Meaningful & Proportion \\\\ \\hline SynLink\\({}_{k,4dapt}\\) & 133 & 93 & 0.70 \\\\ InductivE\\({}_{k,4dapt}\\) & 132 & 106 & 0.80 \\\\ Rel-CSKGC & **174** & **152** & **0.87** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Rel-CSKGC vs. Translation Based methods.\n\nFigure 4: Precision of Rel-CSKGC with different scales of negative samples on the test set by automatic and human evaluation.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline \\hline Method & Total & Intra & Inter \\\\ \\hline CE-random & 0.45 & 0.53 & 0.29 \\\\ KG-BERT & 0.60 & 0.67 & 0.43 \\\\ \\hline Rel-CSKGC & **0.68** & **0.78** & **0.51** \\\\ - w/o random & 0.36 & 0.45 & 0.22 \\\\ - w/o persona & 0.58 & 0.66 & 0.44 \\\\ \\hline Rel-CSKGC\\({}_{human}\\) & 0.80 & 0.91 & 0.62 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Rel-CSKGC vs. Relation Prediction methods on Precision. Intra and Inter indicate the result of the intra- and inter- cluster, respectively.\n\n## 4 Evaluation of the Constructed Dense-Atomic\n\n### Knowledge Coverage and Quality\n\nIn this subsection, we aim to answer the following question: _Does_ Dense-Atomic _yield higher knowledge coverage while ensuring the quality?_\n\nTo this end, we statistically and manually compare Dense-Atomic with Atomic from the following three perspectives.\n\nDense-Atomic yields higher knowledge coverageIn Table 5, we present the comparison between Atomic and Dense-Atomic. Dense-Atomic contains 3x more one-hop paths than Atomic, contributing a significantly higher knowledge coverage. It's worth noting that different tail events in Atomic could become the same after normalizing tail events, so Dense-Atomic contains slightly fewer events than Atomic.\n\nTriplets in Dense-Atomic have relatively high precisionIn Table 3, Rel-CSKGC achieves a precision of 0.80 by human evaluation. Moreover, from comparison results with translation based methods in Table 4, Rel-CSKGC outperforms two state-of-the-art methods by more than 7 percentage points. The high performance of Rel-CSKGC ensures the quality of predicted triplets to a certain extent.\n\nDense-Atomic benefits the performance of ComletTo empirically demonstrate the knowledge coverage and quality of Dense-Atomic, we evaluate Dense-Atomic with \\(\\mathbb{COMET}\\)(Bosselut et al., 2019). The relation distribution of Dense-Atomic is long-tailed. We randomly sample 262,678 triplets from predicted triplets and recover the grouped relations to their original relations by following the relation distribution of the Sap et al. (2019)'s training split. Apart from the evaluation of perplexity, we design a strategy to evaluate the diversity score of generated _tail event_s. For each relation, we randomly sample 10 _head events_ from the test set. For each test sample consisting of a _head event_ and a relation, 10 candidates are generated using beam search. For each candidate, we manually give a score of 0, 1, or 2, representing \"unreasonable\", \"plausible\", and \"reasonable\", respectively. We then merge candidates of similar semantics into a group and calculate the group average score. The diversity score of 10 candidates is the sum of the group scores. Intuitively, the lower perplexity and the higher diversity score indicate the higher knowledge quality and the higher knowledge coverage of Dense-Atomic, and \\(\\mathbb{COMET}_{ours}\\) outperforms \\(\\mathbb{COMET}\\) on both metrics in Table 6. In Table 7, we can find that tail events generated by \\(\\mathbb{COMET}_{ours}\\) are more semantically different.\n\n### Multi-hop Paths in Dense-Atomic\n\nThe aim of this subsection is to answer the question: _Can multi-hop paths in Dense-Atomic better present the commonsense knowledge?_\n\nAccordingly, we evaluate multi-hop paths based on the human evaluation and performing a newly designed Commonsense Reasoning experiment, respectively:\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{PPL \\(\\downarrow\\)} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{DS \\(\\uparrow\\)} \\\\ \\hline \\(\\mathbb{COMET}\\) & 11.14 & 9.16 \\\\ \\(\\mathbb{COMET}_{ours}\\) & **11.11** & **10.77** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 6: \\(\\mathbb{COMET}\\) vs. \\(\\mathbb{COMET}_{ours}\\).

Now, to further validate the correctness of multi-hop paths, we perform the human evaluation on sampled paths to calculate the proportion of reasonable paths. Note that it's a common phenomenon (both KGs and CSKGs) that \\(A\\to B\\) and \\(B\\to C\\) are reasonable, while \\(A\\)\\(\\to B\\to C\\) is irrational. For example, {_Beethoven_, _owner_, _piano_} and {_piano_, _color_, _black_} are two reasonable triplets, but \"_Beethoven_\" and \"_black_\" are not related. Consequently, we additionally design a simple heuristic sampling rule: a multi-hop path \\(A\\rightarrow\\ldots\\to C\\) is chosen only when A and C are also linked in Dense-Atomic. By comparing with random sampling in Table 8, we can find that heuristic rule sampling consistently outperforms random sampling: the longer the multi-hop paths, the more significant the improvement. Multi-hop paths randomly sampled from Dense-Atomic with two different methods are illustrated in Table 9.\n\nDense-Atomic has the potential of providing contextual information for Commonsense ReasoningIn order to further validate the effectiveness of multi-hop paths in Dense-Atomic, we utilize BART Lewis et al. (2020) to perform generative Commonsense Reasoning with or without multi-hop paths. Specifically, with the heuristic rule above, we randomly sample 5000 four-hop paths from Dense-Atomic as the training samples. For test samples, we manually select 500 reasonable paths from Dense-Atomic. BART is trained to generate the subsequent event in two different settings: 1) given only the first node of the path; 2) given the first four nodes of the path. From Table 10, we can find that BART trained with multi-hop paths achieves better performance in that multi-hop paths could provide more contextual information useful for Commonsense Reasoning.\n\n## 5 Related Work\n\nConceptNet Speer et al.

Following translation based methods for the knowledge graph completion (Dettmers et al., 2018; Shang et al., 2019; Meilicke et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Lovelace et al., 2021), Malaviya et al. (2020) additionally densified the CSKG based on BERT similarity and achieve promising results. Wang et al. (2021) and Ju et al. (2022) designed heuristic rules to add more edges for nodes with fewer neighbors. Moghimifar et al. (2021) presented a neural-symbolic reasoner to learn logic rules during the training, making the CSKG completion process interpretable.\n\nRel-CSKGC differs from them in that we utilize pretrained language models to predict the relation given the _head event_ and the _tail event_. Similar relation prediction methods targeting at the knowledge graph completion have been proposed (Socher et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2020). To our best knowledge, we are the first to explore the relation prediction method on CSKG completion.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we construct Dense-Atomic for high knowledge coverage and massive multi-hop paths and accordingly propose a CSKG completion method called Rel-CSKGC to train a relation prediction model and infer the missing links in Atomic. Both automatic and human evaluation show the advantage of Rel-CSKGC over strong baselines. The statistics prove that Dense-Atomic has significantly more triplets and multi-hop paths, providing potential for high-quality downstream applications and multi-hop reasoning based on commonsense knowledge.\n\n## Limitations\n\nOur approach for constructing Dense-Atomic still has two limitations: 1) to keep Dense-Atomic simple, we only consider the most reasonable relation in this paper, while the relation between two events can be complex and diversified. We will release versions of Dense-Atomic with diversified relations later; 2) due to page limitation, we only evaluate Dense-Atomic on simple commonsense reasoning tasks, and we will further validate the multi-hop reasoning capacity of Dense-Atomic on more complex downstream tasks in the future.\n\n## Ethics Statement\n\nWe would like to thank the Allen Institute for AI for their valuable work on Atomic.

We use a maximum sequence length of 100 and batch size of 128. The Adam optimizer is used for optimization with a learning rate of 2e-5 for RoBERTa-large and a learning rate of 1e-4 for MLP layers. The warmup proportion is set to 0.1. We train Rel-CSKGC with 1 NVIDIA RTX 3090 Graphical Card for 5 epochs, and it takes 20 hours to finish the training.\n\n\\(\\mathbb{COFLT}_{ours}\\)To train \\(\\mathbb{COFLT}_{ours}\\), we use the implementations provided here. 4 We use the learning rate of 1.625e-5 and the default values for other parameters.\n\nFootnote 4: [https://github.com/atobsselut/comet-commonsense](https://github.com/atobsselut/comet-commonsense)\n\nGenerative Commonsense ReasoningBART-base is employed as the base model, which contains 140M parameters. We use a batch size of 128 and use the default values for other parameters.\n\n**ACL 2023 Responsible NLP Checklist**\n\nA For every submission:\n\nA1.
